This vitamin has proposed potential power for modulating immune system.48This is achieved via enhancing the phagocytic function of monocytes9and decreasing the secretion of IL-6, IL-12, TNF-α and PGE2 by monocytes.10Also, immature or semi mature APC’s cannot mature in presence of 1,25 (OH)2D.8Many studies showed a role of paracrine function and nerve growth factor synthesis of vitamin D in CNS and also, showed that deficiency of this vitamin in pregnancy period can cause neural system disorder in animal cases.811–14Then, vitamin D has a near relation with MS and the results of different studies can be summarized as follows: First, the effect of latitude via exposure to sun light and serum level of vitamin D on MS prevalence, that increases with distance from equator, with only one exception in Norway.23815Second, Vander et al.']	complex	[2076]	[2083]	PMC3075531_T223
