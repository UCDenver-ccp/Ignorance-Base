PMC3427192.nxml.gz	15	['VDRs are expressed on a variety of airway immune cells, where they function as classic nuclear steroid hormone receptors and ultimately regulate the transcription of numerous genes associated with inflammation and immunomodulation.27Vitamin D also plays an important role in respiratory infection by facilitating Toll-like receptor signaling through increased synthesis of human cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide,28-30which is cleaved to generate the active cationic peptide, LL-37.31,32Vitamin D also exerts direct effects on target cells independent of gene transcription33and may therefore be of relevance to airway inflammatory disorders.34While vitamin D can suppress IL-1735and IL-4-mediated expression of IL-13,35,36it can also shift the Th1/Th2 balance toward Th2 dominance.37These contradictory actions may be due to the direct actions of vitamin D on CD4+T cells to promote an IL-10-secreting T-regulatory population.38\n\nBiosynthesis of vitamin D\nBiosynthesis of vitamin D begins primarily with absorption of solar ultravoilet-B (UVB) radiation and secondarily via consumption of vitamin D-rich and fortified foods, such as oily fish, fortified grains and dairy products.26Following exposure to UVB radiation, 7-dehydrocholesterol within the skin is converted to previtamin D3( Fig.']	(4294, 5587)
