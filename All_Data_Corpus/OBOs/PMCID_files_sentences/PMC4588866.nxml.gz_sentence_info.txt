PMC4588866.nxml.gz	10	['Introduction\nMeasures of prenatal adversity have been associated with adult disease,1but identifying the causal factors has been challenging.2Quasi-experimental studies using the setting of the of the Dutch Hunger Winter of 1944–45,3a 6-month famine, show that exposure to famine during pregnancy may increase the risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidaemia and schizophrenia in the offspring, and have highlighted early gestation as a sensitive period.4\nIn animal experiments, perturbation of prenatal nutrition has been shown to alter epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation which control stable changes in gene expression potential5and are associated with adult phenotype.6Experiments perturbing early maternal nutrition have shown that blastocyst development and the period around implantation is a critical developmental window during which DNA methylation differences may arise.7,8This may be related to the dynamic nature of DNA methylation during this period, as the genome is demethylated after fertilization and remethylated in the period after implantation.9Most animal studies, however, evaluate nutritional perturbations across gestation in relation to DNA methylation differences.10,11\nIn humans, we have shown that prenatal famine exposure is associated with persistent differences in DNA methylation in adulthood and that the relation can depend on of the gestational timing of the exposure.12,13We previously only examined famine exposure during the first or last 10 weeks of gestation in a candidate gene approach12,13and the first 10 weeks in a genome-scale study.14Studies by us and others on prenatal famine,12–15seasonal food shortage16and micro-nutrient supplementation17,18have focused on early gestation as being one period that is critically sensitive in this respect.']	(1914, 3713)
