PMC4872432.nxml.gz	13	['Because DHA is needed for fetal growth, maternal DHA levels steadily decline after 18 weeks of gestation even under normal dietary conditions.1An animal study has shown that when dams were fed a DHA-deficient diet, DHA from their brain was sourced to ensure a sufficient supply of DHA to the fetus, which served to reduce maternal DHA levels by about 25% from pregnancy to lactation.2In a postmortem brain study of patients with depression and controls, women who had two or more children showed DHA levels decreased by 35% on average compared with women who had one child or no children, regardless of disease state.3Because DHA has such important roles in the brain—for example, in serotonergic neurotransmission, dopaminergic function and regulation of corticotropin-releasing factor, as reviewed by Freeman et al.4—it has been hypothesized that if low n-3 PUFA levels are associated with depression, one reason women are more vulnerable to depression in pregnancy is due to the depletion in their n-3 fatty acid levels to support fetal growth.5\nSeveral epidemiological studies have investigated the relationship between n-3 PUFA levels and antenatal and postnatal depression, but the results remain controversial.']	(1957, 3174)
