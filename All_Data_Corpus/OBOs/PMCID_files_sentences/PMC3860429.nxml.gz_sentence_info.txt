PMC3860429.nxml.gz	0	['Epigenetics—New Frontier for Alcohol Research\nThe term “epigenetics” is rapidly becoming one of the more important watchwords in the field of alcohol research.']	(0, 159)
PMC3860429.nxml.gz	1	['Put simply, epigenetics is the study of changes in gene function that occur without a change in the body’s genetic code, instead relying on epigenetic markers on, among others, the DNA and certain nuclear proteins to turn genes “on” and “off.” Epigenetic changes also are brought about by histone modifications, as well as by the role that noncoding RNA (ncRNA) plays.']	(160, 528)
PMC3860429.nxml.gz	2	['By acting on these epigenetic markers, environmental factors such as diet, stress, and prenatal nutrition can make an imprint on the genes that are active in different tissues and at various stages of life.']	(529, 735)

PMC3860429.nxml.gz	6	['In particular, the issue looks at how epigenetics influences the body’s response to alcohol and the development of alcohol use disorders and various disease states.']	(1190, 1354)
PMC3860429.nxml.gz	7	['The concept of epigenetics is not new, originating in the 1940s (Waddington 1942).']	(1355, 1437)
PMC3860429.nxml.gz	8	['The idea was put forth to explain alterations in an organism’s phenotype that could not be attributed to modifications in its genotype.']	(1438, 1573)
PMC3860429.nxml.gz	9	['Or, in more modern terms, epigenetic modifications are the reason that identical DNA sequences can lead to different gene expression profiles.']	(1574, 1716)
PMC3860429.nxml.gz	10	['The specific nature of these modifications, however, has come to light only in recent years.']	(1717, 1809)
PMC3860429.nxml.gz	11	['These findings have painted a fascinating and complex picture involving the coordinated interplay of numerous regulatory epigenetic mechanisms that help ensure the organism’s normal development and function as well as adaptability to changes in environmental conditions.']	(1810, 2080)
PMC3860429.nxml.gz	12	['Importantly, epigenetic modifications of both DNA and histones are time- and tissue- or organ-specific; as a result, disruptions of the epigenome can have vastly diverse consequences, depending on the developmental stage and tissue or organ affected.']	(2081, 2331)
PMC3860429.nxml.gz	13	['One crucial epigenetic mechanism involves methylation of the DNA, particularly in regulatory regions, which typically results in the silencing of genes.']	(2332, 2484)
PMC3860429.nxml.gz	14	['Other modifications center on the histone proteins that help package the DNA in the cell nucleus and which determine how accessible the DNA is to the proteins required for gene expression.']	(2485, 2673)
PMC3860429.nxml.gz	15	['Finally, several types of non–protein-coding RNA transcripts also can influence the epigenetic status of the cell.']	(2674, 2788)
PMC3860429.nxml.gz	16	['If any of these finely tuned mechanisms goes awry, changes in gene expression result that can increase susceptibility to disease (Shukla and colleagues 2008).']	(2789, 2947)
PMC3860429.nxml.gz	17	['In fact, epigenetic mechanisms have been linked to numerous diseases, including cancer, autoimmune disease, and age-related and neurological disorders (Moss and Wallrath 2007;Rodenhiser and Mann 2006).']	(2948, 3149)
PMC3860429.nxml.gz	18	['Environmental factors, including toxic agents and drugs, can exert some of their harmful effects by altering normal epigenetic patterns, leading to abnormal expression or silencing of essential genes and their encoded proteins.']	(3150, 3377)
