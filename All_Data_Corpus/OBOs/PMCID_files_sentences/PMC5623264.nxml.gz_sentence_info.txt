PMC5623264.nxml.gz	28	['Multiple causes of LBW have been identified, which include genetics, early labour, multiple pregnancy, various maternal illnesses (ie, pregnancy-induced hypertension, diabetes mellitus and infections), drug abuse (including tobacco and alcohol), maternal age, height, overweight and obesity along with deprived socioeconomic factors.6Environmental factors, nutritional status and diet of the mother also affect fetal development.7Alterations in the nutrient supply to the fetus result in nutrient deprivation, causing restricted growth.7\nLBW is a major underlying cause of infant mortality and childhood morbidity.8Additionally, there is a clear association between LBW and increased risk for many diseases later in life, such as metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus type 2, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension or cancer.9–11Hence, early interventions starting before or during pregnancy have the potential to prevent LBW and decrease the risks for adverse health outcomes of LBW infants.']	(4934, 5925)
