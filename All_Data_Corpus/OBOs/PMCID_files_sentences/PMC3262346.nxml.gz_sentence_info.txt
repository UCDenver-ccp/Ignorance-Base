PMC3262346.nxml.gz	37	['The spleen is usually fixed in its position in the left upper abdominal quadrant through the splenic pedicle formed by the splenorenal and gastrosplenic ligaments and contains the splenic artery and vein and the tail of the pancreas.3Asymptomatic prevalence of Bochdalek-type hernias in the general population may be as high as 0.17%.4,5Diaphragmatic hernias have also been seen as a result from penetrative or blunt trauma to the chest or abdomen; approximately 100 cases of Bochdalek hernias in adulthood have been reported.6\nThe proposed mechanism for splenic enlargement in this case is as a result of torsion or compression of the splenic pedicle with impairment of venous outflow and resultant splenic congestion and enlargement.3An ectopic abdominal placement of the spleen, or “wandering spleen,” is caused by an elongated splenic vascular pedicle and can produce splenomegaly by a similar mechanism.']	(4741, 5649)
