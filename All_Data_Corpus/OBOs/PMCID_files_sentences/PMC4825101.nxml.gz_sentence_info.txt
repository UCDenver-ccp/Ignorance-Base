PMC4825101.nxml.gz	93	['The rationale for this was three-fold: First, the thymus is central for the early development of controlled adaptive immunity, with thymic development known to start early in the first trimester of pregnancy; second, thymic development is disproportionately affected by both maternal and infant undernutrition, with the description of the thymus as a ‘barometer of malnutrition’ coming long before any role for the thymus gland in immunological memory was known;27and, third, post-natal development of the thymus can be assessed sonographically using a non-invasive validated method in which the transverse diameter of the thymus and the saggital area of its largest lobe are multiplied to give a volume related thymic index (TI).28,29Studies using rodent models have shown that low birth weight, resulting from maternal protein restriction during pregnancy, followed by post-natal catch up growth is associated with shortened lifespan, whereas protein restriction and slow growth during lactation leads to an increased lifespan.30It is proposed that these effects are mediated through differential thymic growth.31Data from infants in Guinea-Bissau, West Africa, and our own data from Bangladesh, indicate that a small thymus in infancy is an independent risk factor for infection-related mortality in infancy.32–34Such data support the importance of early-life thymic development for life-long health.']	(21683, 23086)
