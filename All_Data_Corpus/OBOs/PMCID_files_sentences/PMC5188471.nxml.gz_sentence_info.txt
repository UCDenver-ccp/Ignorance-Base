PMC5188471.nxml.gz	1	['Catch-Up Growth: On What We Know and Why It Matters\nIrrespective of presence of growth restriction at birth, preterm infants are vulnerable to extra-uterine growth restriction (EUGR) during neonatal stay and after discharge, related to cumulative protein and energy deficits.']	(65, 340)
PMC5188471.nxml.gz	2	['The nutritional management of preterm neonates—including very low birth weight (<1500 g) or extremely low birth weight (<1000 g) infants—aims to result in growth patterns that approximate the intra-uterine fetal growth patterns [1].']	(341, 573)
PMC5188471.nxml.gz	3	['If we apply these fetal reference values as a paradigm, a very relevant portion of these preterm patients still develop EUGR during their stay at the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) [2].']	(574, 764)
PMC5188471.nxml.gz	4	['This has clinical relevance, since EUGR and the associated caloric and protein deficits not only result in slower growth velocity, but also are associated with major neonatal morbidities, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity and impaired neurodevelopment [1,3].']	(765, 1054)
PMC5188471.nxml.gz	5	['Along the same line, epidemiologic studies have described additional long-term health consequences of growth restriction and low birth weight, such as an increased risk of cardiovascular (hypertension, microvasculopathy), renal (acute or chronic renal impairment) and metabolic morbidities (insulin resistance, liver steatosis) in adult life, covered in the concept of developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) [4].']	(1055, 1480)

PMC5188471.nxml.gz	8	['Literature suggests that early catch-up growth (i.e., in the first two years of life) is likely beneficial with regard to renal and general health, whereas delayed catch-up growth (i.e., after two years of age) might be harmful [3].']	(1723, 1955)

PMC5188471.nxml.gz	15	['The authors documented that the association of rapid weight gain on health is time critical in preterms: in early infancy, this does not affect metabolic status in adolescence, in contrast to rapid weight gain in childhood, which should be discouraged: indeed no time to waste [3,6].']	(2787, 3070)
PMC5188471.nxml.gz	16	['The concept that the growth-restricted term newborn may be an inaccurate model for the preterm also means that we need to develop clinical research programs to learn more about the most effective intervention strategies and—as relevant—we should collect data on long-term outcomes and the mechanisms involved in former preterm neonates.']	(3071, 3407)
PMC5188471.nxml.gz	17	['To further illustrate this, it is not unlikely that the timing of a nutritional optimization intervention matters in preterm neonates and that (side)-effects may be organ or outcome specific (neuro-development outcomes versus cardiovascular and renal risks) [3,5,6].']	(3408, 3674)
