PMC4785305.nxml.gz	21	['Introduction\n\nVitamin D physiology during pregnancy\nPregnancy is characterised by physiological changes in mineral metabolism, to allow calcium accretion in the fetal skeleton.1–3These changes start in the first trimester, and culminate during the third trimester, a period during which fetal calcium requirements increase exponentially.2Indeed, it is in anticipation of such requirements that maternal calcitriol levels increase during pregnancy.']	(3440, 3887)
PMC4785305.nxml.gz	22	['While the total calcitriol levels double in the first trimester, free calcitriol levels do not increase until the third trimester and remain so until lactation.24Conversely, parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels decrease early on and increase back to mid-normal range by term.2The total calcium level decreases during pregnancy, due to haemodilution, while the ionised calcium level remains stable.2Vitamin D binding proteins also increase during pregnancy secondary to high oestrogen levels,45but the 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) level, the single best nutritional indicator of vitamin D status,6remains stable.7The changes in calcitriol levels led to the description of pregnancy as a state of ‘absorptive hypercalciuria’.12The above adaptive physiology is key to safety considerations when using vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy, as well as to determining key biochemical and hormonal parameters to be monitored.']	(3888, 4809)
PMC4785305.nxml.gz	23	['Maternal vitamin D status during pregnancy\nVitamin D deficiency during pregnancy is prevalent worldwide, especially in developing countries.8In a systematic review of 18 studies conducted in Western countries during the first trimester, white Caucasian pregnant women were found to have a mean 25(OH)D level between 29 and 73\u2005nmol/L.9Mean 25(OH)D levels were lower in non-Caucasian pregnant women, ranging between 15.2 and 43\u2005nmol/L.9In addition to ethnicity, higher latitude was a significant predisposing factor for hypovitaminosis D.9Similarly, in non-Western countries, more than half of the pregnant women who were beyond their first trimester had 25(OH)D levels below 75\u2005nmol/L; these include countries such as India,10Kuwait,11Pakistan12and Turkey.13Even lower levels (<25\u2005nmol/L) have been reported at delivery in Saudi Arabia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates.14Furthermore, immigrant women were at particular risk.1516An observational study from the Netherlands showed significantly lower 25(OH)D levels during the first trimester in immigrant pregnant women (Turkish, Moroccan and others), compared to western participants.17\n\nAssociation between maternal vitamin D status and maternal adverse outcomes\nVitamin D insufficiency during pregnancy is associated with adverse maternal outcomes such as increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), preeclampsia, caesarean-section delivery and bacterial vaginosis.18In a recent meta-analysis of observational studies, the risk of GDM was found to be increased by 40–84% in pregnant women with low 25(OH)D levels, defined as <50\u2005nmol/L or <75\u2005nmol/L, depending on the studies.19–21While preeclampsia risk was significantly increased in vitamin D insufficient women,22C-section rates were inconsistently affected by vitamin D status.23However, these findings remain limited by the inherent biases of observational studies, inconsistent adjustment for confounders, in addition to the wide heterogeneity in vitamin D assays and vitamin D cut-offs definition.']	(4811, 6830)
PMC4785305.nxml.gz	24	["Association between maternal vitamin D level and neonatal adverse outcomes\nLow maternal 25(OH)D levels were recently linked to fetal programming, and were found to be associated with adverse events in neonates, resulting in small for gestational age (SGA) at birth,1923and also later on during childhood, leading to reduced muscle and bone mass in offspring at 4 and 9\u2005years.2425This may be explained by the fact that maternal vitamin D is essential for fetal musculoskeletal integrity, as it regulates neonatal bone accrual, possibly through specific proteins that are responsible for placental calcium transport.26Recently, data from the Southampton Women's Survey (SWS) showed that maternal 25(OH)D level is significantly correlated with placental amino acid transporters expression, that mediate the transport of various nutrients to the fetus.27Furthermore, maternal vitamin D may influence the fetal muscle motor unit size, and consequently muscle mass and strength after birth.25It is noteworthy that fetal bone development is one of the predictors of peak bone mass, adult bone mineral content and hip geometry, thus correlating with fracture risk later in life.2628\n\nVitamin D replacement guidelines during pregnancy\nThe guidelines regarding vitamin D replacement or supplementation during pregnancy vary substantially."]	(6832, 8160)
