PMC5652542.nxml.gz	14	['Complex milk lipids (CML), as a source of GA, have potential benefits for brain development.19–21The rate of GA accretion in the developing brain is highest in utero and in early neonatal life.22 23Preclinical research has shown that CML are transferred across the placenta and as such, an increased maternal intake of CML in pregnancy has been associated with increases in fetal GA levels.24–26Human milk fat globules are stabilised by the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM), which contains complex milk lipids such as glycerophospholipids, sphingomyelin, GA and cerebrosides.27 28Infant dietary GA intakes are highest in breastfed infants, and research in animal models and small-scale infant nutrition intervention studies have shown that supplementation of CML (containing GA) in the neonatal period may improve cognitive outcomes.21 29–31\nTherefore, we hypothesise that a higher maternal intake of CML in pregnancy, serving as an additional source of GA, will increase GA status in both mother and offspring, with potential benefits relating to brain development and general health in the infant, especially during the first year of life.']	(3335, 4476)
