PMC5695303.nxml.gz	17	['Introduction\nSupporting all women to achieve healthy gestational weight gain (GWG) is of clinical importance because GWG lower or higher than recommended is linked to a range of poor maternal, fetal and childhood outcomes.1For mothers, excess GWG increases the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus and hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, and this is of special concern if excessive GWG occurs early in pregnancy.2–4Excess GWG also poses risks at delivery for the mother including increased likelihood of needing an instrumental delivery or a caesarean section, and surgical morbidity and mortality.1 3Furthermore, these factors result in an increased risk for the fetus and neonate including the adverse consequences of macrosomia and shoulder dystocia, need for intensive care unit admission and the risk of perinatal death.1 3 5In the long term, the child is at risk of an altered growth trajectory that may lead to obesity.6 7Excess GWG also increases the risk of postpartum weight retention, which may leave a woman at an increased body mass index (BMI) to begin her next pregnancy.1 8The cycle of excess GWG followed by postpartum weight retention and increasing maternal BMI can lead to increased risk in each subsequent pregnancy.9These risks act synergistically resulting in a higher risk of metabolic and cardiovascular disease in later life for the mother as well as the child.10Thus, excess GWG has short-term, long-term and intergenerational effects.11\nTo mitigate the risks of inappropriate GWG, many countries, including Canada, have released GWG guidelines.12 13Many of these are based on the Institute of Medicine (IOM)\xa0(USA) guidelines for GWG in pregnancy, which outline a range of total GWG over the course of pregnancy that is associated with optimal health outcomes for mother and child.14In order for these guidelines to be of benefit to pregnant women, the IOM recommends that healthcare providers advise women on the recommended range of GWG based on prepregnancy BMI, and that they track and discuss weight progress over the course of pregnancy, as well as offering tailored counselling on dietary intake and physical activity.15Many countries provide guidance to healthcare providers in the form of evidence-based guidelines in order to support them in providing physical activity and nutrition counselling to pregnant women.16–19\nThere is growing evidence to suggest that the quality of GWG counselling interactions needs improvement, as women and healthcare providers report conflicting views of these interactions.20Many women report that their healthcare provider did not provide recommendations for GWG during their prenatal care, nor provide counselling about nutrition and physical activity behaviours during pregnancy21 22\xa0Healthcare providers have reported taking a reactive approach, initiating a discussion about weight in pregnancy only after weight exceeds the recommendations.23 24\xa0Healthcare providers may lack knowledge or skills to undertake this type of counselling,25 26or consider GWG to be a low priority in the context of a typical prenatal visit.23\nWomen may see a variety of healthcare provider disciplines for prenatal care including general practitioners, obstetricians, midwives, nurse practitioners and registered nurses.27There is some evidence to suggest that the approach to GWG counselling may vary by healthcare provider discipline28 29; however, this area has not been fully explored.']	(3061, 6507)
