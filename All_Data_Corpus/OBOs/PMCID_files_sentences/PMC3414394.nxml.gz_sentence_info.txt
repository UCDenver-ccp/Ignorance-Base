PMC3414394.nxml.gz	10	['Introduction\nLow birth weight (LBW), defined as birth weight < 2,500 g, is a common measure of overall fetal and maternal health.1Several lines of evidence suggest that LBW may also function as a marker of adult health,2as LBW neonates are at increased risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, obesity and some cancers in adulthood.3-8This epidemiological evidence supports the developmental origin of health and disease (DOHAD) hypothesis, which postulates that the adaptive response to prenatal and early postnatal environment can affect disease susceptibility in adulthood.6,9-11\nPrenatal depression has been associated with poor birth outcomes including LBW,12and a growing emphasis has been placed on screening for psychosocial risk factors during pregnancy as a strategy to reduce poor birth outcomes.13Depression is one of the most common psychiatric disorders among young adults and is associated with substantial morbidity, particularly during pregnancy.14In the US, the prevalence of depressive symptoms in the antenatal period ranges from 10–15% depending on gestational age, race/ethnicity and socioeconomic factors.15As many as 12.7% of pregnant women experience at least one major depressive episode during pregnancy.15Both maternal depression and poor birth outcomes disproportionately affect Blacks and Hispanics compared with Whites.16-18Mechanistic insights that can guide public health or therapeutic intervention efforts to alleviate this disparity are required.']	(1667, 3165)

PMC3414394.nxml.gz	12	['Studies largely target promoter regions of genes, as research on tumor suppressor genes has suggested that aberrant methylation at promoter regions may lead to transcriptional silencing.11However, imprinted genes, or parent of origin dependent monoallelic expression regulated by methylation that is established differentially on the two parental chromosomes, may play a role in many disease processes.20Epigenetic changes at cis-acting differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that regulate imprinted gene expression are important not only in maintaining the imprinted status of these genes but also in controlling their levels of expression.21,22Since these methylation marks are established before gastrulation, they are maintained in all somatic tissues.21,22Because these genes occur in clusters, are enriched for growth regulators and intricately interact to coordinate early growth, methylation alterations at a single DMR may lead to changes in the regulation of multiple genes.21,23,24The objectives of this analysis were to examine the association between prenatal maternal depressed mood in relation to birth weight and to evaluate the role of DNA methylation at nine imprinted regulatory sequences in this association.']	(3513, 4743)
