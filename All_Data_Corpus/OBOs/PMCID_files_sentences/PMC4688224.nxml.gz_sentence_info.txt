PMC4688224.nxml.gz	9	['Introduction\nChildhood obesity is a major public health problem in the United States (US), where 17% of children are obese and another 15% are overweight.1Excess adiposity is difficult to reverse once established and increases the risk of cardiometabolic, pulmonary, and musculoskeletal disorders.2There is growing evidence that prenatal chemical exposures may play a role in childhood obesity risk by perturbing biological pathways involved in energy metabolism, appetite, or adipogenesis.3\nPerfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which have been used in oil and water resistant textile coatings, non-stick cookware, food container coatings, floor polish, fire-fighting foam, and industrial surfactants, are a class of suspected obesogens that are persistent in the environment and humans.4–6Biomonitoring studies demonstrate nearly ubiquitous exposure to four PFAS in the US population: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS).7,8\nSome experimental rodent and in vitro studies show that PFAS exposure may cause impaired glucose homeostasis, increased body weight, and altered adipocyte differentiation,9–12while others do not.13Four prospective epidemiological studies have examined the relationship between early life PFAS exposure and child or adult adiposity (Table S1).14–17Two studies reported no associations between prenatal or early childhood PFAS exposure and child or adult adiposity.14,15A third study reported that maternal serum PFOA concentrations during pregnancy were associated with increased adiposity, risk of being overweight or obese, and serum leptin concentrations in adults.16A fourth study reported more rapid weight gain in girls born to women with higher serum PFOS concentrations during pregnancy.17\nWe used data from a cohort of pregnant women with median serum PFOA concentrations that were over two-times higher than pregnant women in the US to examine the relationship between prenatal PFAS exposures and longitudinal measures of adiposity in children between 2 and 8 years of age.']	(1405, 3516)
