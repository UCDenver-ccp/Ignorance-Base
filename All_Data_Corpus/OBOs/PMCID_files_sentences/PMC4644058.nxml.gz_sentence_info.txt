PMC4644058.nxml.gz	31	['DISCUSSION\nThe exact mechanism of GUI is believed to be due to trapping of the uterine fundus in a retroverted position, which leads to a progressively elongated cervix that becomes displaced anteriorly and leads to obstructive bladder symptoms.2Risk factors for this condition include post-surgical adhesions, pelvic inflammatory disease, fibroids, and laxity of supporting tissues.3The most typical presentation occurs between 14 and 16 weeks of gestation with a variety of symptoms mimicking common gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and musculoskeletal conditions.']	(4367, 4933)
PMC4644058.nxml.gz	32	['Physical findings include anterior displacement of the uterus, anterior angulation of the vaginal angle, retroverted uterus, cervical displacement toward cephalad and a low-lying fundal height for gestational age.4\nThough urinary tract infections (UTI) are by far the most common cause of dysuria in pregnant patients, a patient with a GUI can easily be misdiagnosed as a UTI even by experienced clinicians.']	(4934, 5341)
PMC4644058.nxml.gz	33	['Though these patients’ particular presentations did not appear alarming, they could have easily been disregarded as normal pregnancy pain or Braxton-Hicks contractions if careful attention to detail was not made.']	(5342, 5554)
PMC4644058.nxml.gz	34	['The complications of a missed GUI are rare, but could be potentially disastrous and life threatening.']	(5555, 5656)
PMC4644058.nxml.gz	35	['These complications include hydronephrosis, UTI, bladder rupture, sepsis, peritonitis, miscarriage, oligohydramnios, fetal growth restriction, and fetal demise.5–7Even if these immediate complications are not present, delayed complications can include a pregnancy loss of up to 33% in the second trimester.8,9Because of the potential of these serious complications, this is a diagnosis that should be considered more frequently in the ED, especially in community care settings such as ours, where obstetric patients make up a large portion of the ED census per year.']	(5657, 6223)
PMC4644058.nxml.gz	36	['Though GUI has been extensively described in the literature, there are few reports of its actual diagnosis in the ED setting.']	(6224, 6349)
PMC4644058.nxml.gz	37	['During a literature search we did find one case report where an ED noted that a patient had a clinically incarcerated uterus; however, there was no ultrasonographic evidence of bladder obstruction in this particular case.10We believe that our case series is the first known series of GUI diagnosis in the ED using bedside ultrasonography.']	(6350, 6688)
PMC4644058.nxml.gz	38	['Although there are no established gold standard tests for GUI, both ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging seem to be acceptable modalities for confirming the diagnosis.11,12This case demonstrates one of the many utilities of ultrasound in the ED setting, particularly in experienced operators.']	(6689, 6986)
