PMC5483985.nxml.gz	14	["HIV and fertility are positively associated in adolescents, as women who have unprotected sex have higher risk of both HIV acquisition and pregnancy.7However, older HIV-positive women have lower fertility rates than HIV-negative women.4,7HIV infection has been shown through biological pathways to reduce the ability to conceive and bear a live child.8–12Social and behavioral factors are also related to lower fertility in HIV-positive women because of altered childbearing desires11,13–16and likelihood of being in a relationship.17In Malawi and other high HIV-prevalence countries, widespread availability of antiretroviral treatment (ART) has removed many of the biological barriers to fertility by improving health and survival of women and their partners,18,19which has been shown to increase people's desire for children,20,21although this may not correlate with actual fertility.22There is, however, still uncertainty surrounding the impact of increased access to ART on fertility in HIV-positive women.23\nMalawi has adopted a public health approach24to its HIV epidemic with sector-wide policies to maximize ART uptake in HIV-positive people, including Option B+25: from July 2011, all pregnant and breastfeeding women were eligible for lifelong ART regardless of immunological status, and in 2016, universal ART eligibility was introduced so all HIV-positive people should be offered ART at the time of testing.26Before Option B+, prevention of mother-to-child transmission programmes involved HIV testing for pregnant women and short courses of ART, taken until completion of breastfeeding.27Since 2011, the guidelines in Malawi have promoted provider-initiated family planning but specifically stated that “Health workers should not actively discourage pregnancy” in HIV-positive women.28\nStudying trends in fertility is important, as it enables long-term planning for services required for pregnant women and their children at various stages in their lives."]	(2567, 4537)
