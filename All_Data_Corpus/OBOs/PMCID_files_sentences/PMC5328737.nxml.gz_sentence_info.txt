PMC5328737.nxml.gz	9	['Increasing evidence suggests that long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) may be important in fetal development and the accretion of maternal, placental, and fetal tissue.1–4In particular, n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), comprise the major structural fat of the human brain and eyes.5–7The Japanese diet is rich in n-3 PUFAs due to a high consumption of seafood, and the epidemiological benefits of these fatty acids have been widely reported.8–11\nFood frequency questionnaires (FFQs) are useful for assessing dietary habits and quantitatively estimating usual food consumption over a fixed period of time.']	(2037, 2722)

PMC5328737.nxml.gz	11	['The relative validity of the FFQ for assessing LC-PUFA intake in Japan has been previously reported.13,14However, a validation study of the FFQ for pregnant women is required, as pregnant women are likely to experience a change in dietary habits as well as appetite or to choose food that is different than their pre-pregnancy diet, which consequently changes their everyday dietary intake.15,16\nAlthough plurality of dietary records (DR) is the most frequent reference method to validate FFQs, biomarkers that show a strong direct relationship with the nutrient of interest may also be used as a reference to validate the FFQ, as their measurement errors would be independent from those of dietary assessment methods.17,18For dietary EPA and DHA intake measured by FFQs, several previous studies have used EPA and DHA concentrations in the blood for validation.19,20\nThe aim of this study was to verify the external validity of an FFQ, which was originally developed for non-pregnant adults, to assess the dietary intake of LC-PUFAs using the dietary records and biomarkers of LC-PUFAs in serum phospholipid levels among women in early and late pregnancy.']	(3041, 4197)
