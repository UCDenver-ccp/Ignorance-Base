PMC5656136.nxml.gz	26	['Introduction\nGlobally, 20 million babies are born with low birth weight (LBW) each year, the majority of them in low/middle-income countries.1LBW is defined as a weight at birth of less than 2500 g2and can be caused by preterm delivery (ie, before 37 weeks gestation), intrauterine growth restriction or by a combination of both.3LBW babies account for >80% of neonatal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia and small babies who survive the neonatal period are still at risk of detrimental outcomes, including stunting in childhood, neurocognitive impairment and non-communicable diseases later in life.4 5\nAlthough great progress has been made over the last decade in the reduction of under-five mortality, the reduction of neonatal mortality has been much slower and neonatal deaths now account for 45% of the global under-five deaths.5–7In order to reduce neonatal mortality rates and improve long-term outcomes, it is crucial to target the care practices for LBW babies.']	(4168, 5151)
PMC5656136.nxml.gz	27	['There is good evidence that interventions in the postnatal period, such as Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC), immediate and exclusive breast\xa0feeding, hygienic cord care and early detection and treatment of suspected infections can improve early mortality outcomes.8–10Furthermore, there is convincing evidence that adequate stimulation and responsiveness of parents in the neonatal and infant period in combination with improved nutrition can benefit early child development.11 12Despite this, both funding and action are still lacking and leadership for newborn health has been poor.13\nMalawi has a neonatal mortality rate of 22/1000\u2009live births and preterm birth rates are among the highest in the world.14Previous qualitative studies in Malawi have highlighted that poor community care practices for preterm babies are associated with a lack of knowledge on appropriate care and poverty.15Since 2002, Malawi has scaled-up KMC in health facilities, and although there is a positive attitude towards the practice, compliance and continuation of KMC are hindered by a lack of support, culture and stigma.16Strengthened linkages are needed between health facilities and the community to support early discharge and follow-up for these vulnerable newborns.']	(5152, 6399)
