PMC5724074.nxml.gz	21	['Introduction\n\nBackground and rationale\nGlobally more than 20\u2009million infants are born with low birthweight (LBW) (<2500\u2009g) every year, 96% in low and middle-income countries.1Neonates weighing less than 2500 g are approximately three times more likely to die compared with those weighing 2500 g or more at birth, and the risk increases as birth- weight decreases.']	(3032, 3395)
PMC5724074.nxml.gz	22	['LBW indirectly accounts for 60% of the deaths among neonates and more than 13\u2009million disability adjusted life years among children aged less than five years.2LBW significantly impacts on health throughout the life course; in childhood it causes hyperactivity and inattention, emotional and behavioural problems and poor educational attainment,3while in adulthood it leads to the development of chronic diseases4and lower economic productivity.5\nIntrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is the probable cause of LBW in babies born at term (≥37 weeks of gestation)2; this may be partly due to the impairment of the placental development and function in the presence of maternal undernutrition.6There is strong evidence that poor maternal nutrition during pregnancy leads to intrauterine growth restriction and thus LBW.7–9Thirteen percent of Bangladeshi women of reproductive age (15–49 years) are short statured (height <145\u2009cm) and 19% are thin (body mass index <18.5 kg/m2),10which indicates that these women enter pregnancy with chronic undernutrition.']	(3396, 4449)
PMC5724074.nxml.gz	23	['Moreover, in Bangladesh during pregnancy women consume far less than the recommended dietary energy.']	(4450, 4550)
PMC5724074.nxml.gz	24	['Alam and colleagues found that the average daily energy intake among Bangladeshi women in late pregnancy was 1464±416 kcal per day, much lower than the recommendation of ~2500\u2009kcal.11Among women from low-income families, diets lack protein and micronutrients.7Dietary diversity, which is believed to be strongly associated with nutrient adequacy, was 4.5 (out of nine food subgroups) in women’s regular diet in rural Bangladesh.8This nutritional deprivation during pregnancy may impair placental development, leading to reduced nutrient transfer to the fetus and ultimately to IUGR.9A longitudinal study conducted in Iran between 2009 and 2010 found that energy and protein intake was associated with the birthweight of infants.']	(4551, 5279)
PMC5724074.nxml.gz	25	['Pregnant women who consumed 1794±54\u2009kcal per day gave birth to neonates with a mean birthweight of 2600 g, whereas pregnant women who consumed 2698±107\u2009kcal gave birth to neonates with a mean birth- weight of 3600 g. Similarly, an increase in protein intake from 38.7±4.7\u2009g to 72.8±7.4 g per day was associated with an increased birthweight from 2500 g to 3400 g.12\nAntenatal nutrition education has been found to improve dietary behaviour and significantly increase total energy intake (from 2269 to 2431 kcal per day, p<0.05) among low-income pregnant women.13A systematic review examined the effect of antenatal nutrition education on birthweight of infants and found a significant increase in birthweight by 105 g. However, the stratified analysis showed that the effect was significant only for high-income countries and when nutrition education was provided with nutritional supplementation.14A Cochrane review reported a significant increase in birthweight among undernourished women who received nutrition education (difference in mean 490 g; 95%\u2009CI 428-552 g), while no significant increase was observed for adequately nourished women.15These findings are based on studies with some methodological weaknesses including small sample size or few events and quasi-experimental studies or randomised controlled trials with design or analysis limitations.']	(5280, 6639)
