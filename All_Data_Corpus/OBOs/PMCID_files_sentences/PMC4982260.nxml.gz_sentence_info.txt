PMC4982260.nxml.gz	5	['From this experience, it’s evident that much can be done, even in very resource-constrained settings, to improve key elements of care of preterm and very small newborns, notably:\nGood thermal care —maximizing skin-to-skin contact\nConscientious and capable attention given to feeding —relying on breastmilk only, to the extent appropriate, and providing any needed support, e.g., breastmilk expression and cup feeding or tube feeding\nVigilance, through good nursing care , to pick up complications early and respond appropriately\nOmotayo et al.']	(1114, 1657)
