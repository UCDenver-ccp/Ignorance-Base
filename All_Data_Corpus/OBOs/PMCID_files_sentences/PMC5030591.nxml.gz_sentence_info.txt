PMC5030591.nxml.gz	15	['Introduction\nRheumatoid arthritis (RA) typically occurs in women during their childbearing years,1with a prevalence that has increased over the last 15\u2005years2and is expected to increase in coming decades.3Compounded with the prospect of living with a chronic, painful and sometimes progressive disease associated with substantial physical and mental health impacts,4young women with RA and their families face additional challenges in navigating a safe and successful pathway to parenthood.5Specifically, this pathway requires informed, collaborative decision-making and careful planning on the part of the patient and health professional(s) around RA disease activity monitoring and safe pharmacological management, physical and emotional health, and social support as they relate to contraception, conception and pregnancy, birth, breast feeding and early parenting.15–10\nOur recent primary research investigating the information and service needs of Australian women with RA concerning pregnancy, breast feeding and early parenting identified a dearth of contemporary information available to support women to make informed decisions and implement practical coping strategies.6In particular, our data suggest that women with RA have clear pregnancy-related educational needs and seek specific information from their care providers about medicines safety during pregnancy and breast feeding, physical and emotional support services and practical coping strategies to manage pain and flares during the postnatal period.6Moreover, in a recent systematic review and editorial, we identified a lack of self-management interventions for women with RA targeted towards these issues,911despite European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations that specific patient education is critical at important life and disease course stages12and published Standards of Care for RA that recommend comprehensive and individually tailored education about RA and its management.13While some consumer texts1415and arthritis organisation web pages have been developed to address information gaps in this area, they remain limited and inadequately address some of the most important issues raised by women relating to disease management and medicines safety during pregnancy and breast feeding.56Consequently, treating health professionals (particularly rheumatologists) remain the primary communicators of such information, which is expected by patients616and entirely appropriate for the majority of cases.12Given that patients’ information needs vary,6highly prescriptive guidelines are unlikely to be of use in clinical practice and do not align well with a patient-centred model of care.']	(2765, 5445)
