PMC4544362.nxml.gz	78	['A possible explanation for greater adiposity among children of mothers who stopped smoking in the first trimester of pregnancy is the excessive gain of weight associated with quitting smoking during pregnancy.1Indeed, excessive gain of weight during pregnancy is positively associated with adiposity in children.7Furthermore, quitting smoking can cause a great deal of stress to the body, and prenatal exposure to maternal stress or anxiety is associated with elevated maternal cortisol,25which can potentially lead to altered metabolism in later life, associated with adiposity and diabetes.5\nIn Brazil, analyses comprising children aged 8-10 years from a cohort of Ribeirao Preto (born between 1987-1989) showed no association between exposure to smoking during pregnancy and overweight in childhood.26In the same cohort (born between 1978-1979), however, adolescents whose mothers had smoked during pregnancy reported higher mean BMI at the age of 18 years.10Another Brazilian cohort (the Pelotas cohort) showed that children younger than four years exposed to maternal smoking during pregnancy had higher BMI z-scores for age in childhood.19\nThe present study indicates that the period of exposition to maternal smoking affects the risk of gain of weight.']	(19270, 20529)
