PMC1626432.nxml.gz	1	['The CDC currently recommends that all women of childbearing age eat a diet high in folic acid or take a daily multivitamin with 0.4 mg of folic acid each day, with higher intake from before conception through the first three months of pregnancy.']	(262, 507)

PMC1626432.nxml.gz	8	['The results showed that certain SNPs in the betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase ( BHMT ) gene were significantly associated with NTDs, and that the significance was strongest with mothers who took folate supplements before conception.']	(1548, 1785)
PMC1626432.nxml.gz	9	['The group also found an associative gene–gene interaction: significance increased in the BHMT rs3733890 SNP when the data were stratified by preferential transmission of one particular MTHFR allele from parent to offspring.']	(1786, 2009)

PMC1626432.nxml.gz	11	['The authors speculate that the stratification method they employed may have inadvertently grouped families by one or more unidentified cofactors correlated with folate supplementation, or that the BHMT polymorphism may create a genetic variant that promotes overactivity of the folate metabolic cycle, given the high folate levels achieved during supplementation.']	(2138, 2501)
