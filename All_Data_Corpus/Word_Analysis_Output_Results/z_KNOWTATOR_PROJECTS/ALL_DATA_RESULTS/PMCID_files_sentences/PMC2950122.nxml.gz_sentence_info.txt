PMC2950122.nxml.gz	3	['To train every cadre of field worker in research ethics requires simplified training guidelines that can be easily translated and adapted for use in a wide variety of settings and cultural frameworks, especially where field workers have limited formal education.']	(649, 911)

PMC2950122.nxml.gz	10	['We propose the term data collector to designate a distinct role on the study team for field workers who seek informed consent or collect data through direct contact with individuals.']	(1834, 2016)
PMC2950122.nxml.gz	11	["When investigators delegate such activities to data collectors, the investigators' ultimate responsibility for human subject protection and scientific integrity is in no way diminished and requires them to train these personnel in the principles and practice of research ethics."]	(2017, 2295)
PMC2950122.nxml.gz	12	['Due to a lack of standard training guidelines specific to field workers in low-resource settings, training may vary between sites and principal investigators.']	(2296, 2454)
PMC2950122.nxml.gz	13	['Consequently, the effective implementation of research ethics principles may also vary widely and arbitrarily across settings.']	(2455, 2581)

PMC2950122.nxml.gz	15	['We locate our studies at sites where the targeted problem confers a significant burden and research findings will be most directly applicable—most often in low-resource settings, among populations exposed to social or economic stress, and within cultural frameworks that range from sub-Saharan to Southeast Asian[8]–[16].']	(2890, 3211)
PMC2950122.nxml.gz	16	['As our studies can range in size from hundreds to tens of thousands of participants, we find that tailoring research ethics training to the many cadres of workers potentially engaged in human subject contact is both time-consuming and difficult to standardize.']	(3212, 3472)

PMC2950122.nxml.gz	37	['As an agent representing study investigators and the institutions charged with ethical oversight of the research protocol, the data collector bears two weighty responsibilities: to act respectfully and otherwise appropriately toward each study participant with whom he or she has contact for research purposes; and to safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of the data that he or she collects[19].']	(7197, 7599)
PMC2950122.nxml.gz	38	["Second, the Guide presents the two main responsibilities of the data collector's role in concrete terms that trainers can readily convey to workers in the field."]	(7600, 7761)
PMC2950122.nxml.gz	39	['This includes detailed instruction on specific behaviors that promote basic ethical principles: for example, paying attention to body language when seeking informed consent or recording interview responses, and safeguarding data collection sheets to protect the confidentiality of personal information[19].']	(7762, 8068)
