For the ancient Greeks and Romans, Apollo was the god of medicine and healing as well as of sun and lightâbut Apollo could bring sickness as well as cure. Todayâs scientists have come to a similarly dichotomous recognition that exposure to the ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in sunlight has both beneficial and deleterious effects on human health.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>509</offset><text>Most public health messages of the past century have focused on the hazards of too much sun exposure. UVA radiation (95â97% of the UVR that reaches Earthâs surface) penetrates deeply into the skin, where it can contribute to skin cancer indirectly via generation of DNA-damaging molecules such as hydroxyl and oxygen radicals. Sunburn is caused by too much UVB radiation; this form also leads to direct DNA damage and promotes various skin cancers. Both forms can damage collagen fibers, destroy vitamin A in skin, accelerate aging of the skin, and increase the risk of skin cancers. Excessive sun exposure can also cause cataracts and diseases aggravated by UVR-induced immunosuppression such as reactivation of some latent viruses.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1247</offset><text>However, excessive UVR exposure accounts for only 0.1% of the total global burden of disease in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), according to the 2006 World Health Organization (WHO) report The Global Burden of Disease Due to Ultraviolet Radiation. DALYs measure how much a personâs expectancy of healthy life is reduced by premature death or disability caused by disease. Coauthor Robyn Lucas, an epidemiologist at the National Centre for Epidemiology and Population Health in Canberra, Australia, explains that many diseases linked to excessive UVR exposure tend to be relatively benignâapart from malignant melanomaâand occur in older age groups, due mainly to the long lag between exposure and manifestation, the requirement of cumulative exposures, or both. Therefore, when measuring by DALYs, these diseases incur a relatively low disease burden despite their high prevalence.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2143</offset><text>In contrast, the same WHO report noted that a markedly larger annual disease burden of 3.3 billion DALYs worldwide might result from very low levels of UVR exposure.

At least 1,000 different genes governing virtually every tissue in the body are now thought to be regulated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25[OH]D), the active form of the vitamin, including several involved in calcium metabolism and neuromuscular and immune system functioning.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2913</offset><text>Although most of the health-promoting benefits of sun exposure are thought to occur through vitamin D photosynthesis, there may be other health benefits that have gone largely overlooked in the debate over how much sun is needed for good health [see âOther Sun-Dependent Pathways,â p.

As for what constitutes âexcessiveâ UVR exposure, there is no one-size-fits-all answer, says Lucas: ââExcessiveâ really means inappropriately high for your skin type under a particular level of ambient UVR.â</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>3429</offset><text>Vitamin D Production</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3450</offset><text>Unlike other essential vitamins, which must be obtained from food, vitamin D can be synthesized in the skin through a photosynthetic reaction triggered by exposure to UVB radiation. The efficiency of production depends on the number of UVB photons that penetrate the skin, a process that can be curtailed by clothing, excess body fat, sunscreen, and the skin pigment melanin. For most white people, a half-hour in the summer sun in a bathing suit can initiate the release of 50,000 IU (1.25 mg) vitamin D into the circulation within 24 hours of exposure; this same amount of exposure yields 20,000â30,000 IU in tanned individuals and 8,000â10,000 IU in dark-skinned people.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4128</offset><text>The initial photosynthesis produces vitamin D3, most of which undergoes additional transformations, starting with the production of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D), the major form of vitamin D circulating in the bloodstream and the form that is routinely measured to determine a personâs vitamin D status. Although various cell types within the skin can carry out this transformation locally, the conversion takes place primarily in the liver. Another set of transformations occurs in the kidney and other tissues, forming 1,25(OH)D.

In August 2007, the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research published Effectiveness and Safety of Vitamin D in Relation to Bone Health, a systematic review of 167 studies that found âfair evidenceâ of an association between circulating 25(OH)D concentrations and either increased bone-mineral density or reduced falls in older people (a result of strengthened muscles as well as strengthened bones). âLow vitamin D levels will precipitate and exacerbate osteoporosis in both men and women and cause the painful bone disease osteomalacia,â says Holick.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>6179</offset><text>Evolution of the Great Solar Debate</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6215</offset><text>In the 2002 book Bone Loss and Osteoporosis in Past Populations: An Anthropological Perspective, Reinhold Vieth, a nutrition professor at the University of Toronto, writes that early primates probably acquired their relatively high vitamin D requirements from frequent grooming and ingestion of oils rich in vitamin D precursors that were secreted by their skin onto their fur. The first humans evolved in equatorial Africa, where the direct angle of sunlight delivers very strong UVR most of the year. The gradual loss of protective fur may have created evolutionary pressure to develop deeply pigmented skin to avoid photodegradation of micronutrients and protect sweat glands from UVR-induced injury.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6919</offset><text>In the July 2000 issue of the Journal of Human Evolution, California Academy of Sciences anthropologists Nina Jablonski and George Chaplin wrote that because dark skin requires about five to six times more solar exposure than pale skin for equivalent vitamin D photosynthesis, and because the intensity of UVB radiation declines with increasing latitude, one could surmise that skin lightening was an evolutionary adaptation that allowed for optimal survival in low-UVR climes, assuming a traditional diet and outdoor lifestyle. Cooler temperatures in these higher latitudes resulted in the need for more clothing and shelter, further reducing UVR exposure. With shorter winter days and insufficient solar radiation in the UVB wavelengths needed to stimulate vitamin D synthesis, dietary sources such as fatty fish became increasingly important.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7765</offset><text>Over time, clothing became the norm in higher latitudes and then eventually a social attribute in many societies. By the 1600s, peoples in these regions covered their whole body, even in summertime. Many children who lived in the crowded and polluted industrialized cities of northern Europe developed rickets. By the late 1800s, approximately 90% of all children living in industrialized Europe and North America had some manifestations of the disease, according to estimates based on autopsy studies of the day cited by Holick in the August 2006 Journal of Clinical Investigation and the October 2007 American Journal of Public Health.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8403</offset><text>Doctors throughout Europe and North America began promoting whole-body sun-bathing to help prevent rickets. It was also recognized that wintertime sunlight in the temperate zone was too feeble to prevent rickets.

TB patients of all ages were sent to rest in sunny locales and generally returned in good health. Dermatology professor Barbara A. Gilchrest of Boston University School of Medicine says that, whereas sun exposure was shown to improve cutaneous TB, sanatorium patients with pulmonary TB likely responded as much or more to rest and good nutrition than to UVR. Nevertheless, a meta-analysis published in the February 2008 International Journal of Epidemiology found that high vitamin D levels reduce the risk of active TB (i.e., TB showing clinical symptoms) by 32%.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9552</offset><text>Almost overnight, as awareness of the sunâs power against rickets and TB spread, attitudes toward sun exposure underwent a radical shift.

Phototherapy quickly emerged as a popular medical treatment not only for TB, but also for rheumatic disorders, diabetes, gout, chronic ulcers, and wounds.

Nevertheless, it was not until the 1930s that the U.S. Public Health Service began issuing warnings about sun-related health risks.

To counter this threat, the WHO, the United Nations Environment Programme, the World Meteorological Organization, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, and the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection established INTERSUN, the Global UV Project, with the express goal of reducing the burden of UVR-related disease. INTERSUN activities have included the development of an internationally recognized UV Index to help frame sun protection messages related to the daily intensity of UVR.

As a result of increased use of hats, sunscreen, and shade, the incidence of malignant melanoma has begun to plateau in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Northern Europe among some age groups. However, because other UVR-induced skin cancers typically take longer than melanoma to develop, their incidence rates continue to rise in most developed countries.

A randomized clinical trial by Joan Lappe, a medical professor at Creighton University, and colleagues, published in the June 2007 issue of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, confirmed that taking 2â4 times the daily dietary reference intake of 200â600 IU vitamin D3 and calcium resulted in a 50â77% reduction in expected incidence rates of all cancers combined over a four-year period in post-menopausal women living in Nebraska.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>13620</offset><text>Moreover, although excessive sun exposure is an established risk factor for cutaneous malignant melanoma, continued high sun exposure was linked with increased survival rates in patients with early-stage melanoma in a study reported by Marianne Berwick, an epidemiology professor at the University of New Mexico, in the February 2005 Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

Populations at higher latitudes have a higher incidence and prevalence of MS; a review in the December 2002 issue of Toxicology by epidemiology professor Anne-Louise Ponsonby and colleagues from The Australian National University revealed that living at a latitude above 37Â° increased the risk of developing MS throughout life by greater than 100%.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14968</offset><text>Still to be resolved, however, is the question of what levels of vitamin D are optimal for preventing the diseaseâand whether the statistical associations reflect different gene pools rather than different levels of 25(OH)D.

Nonobese mice of a strain predisposed to develop type 1 diabetes showed an 80% reduced risk of developing the disease when they received a daily dietary dose of 1,25(OH)D, according to research published in the June 1994 issue of the same journal. And a Finnish study published 3 November 2001 in The Lancet showed that children who received 2,000 IU vitamin D per day from 1 year of age on had an 80% decreased risk of developing type 1 diabetes later in life, whereas children who were vitamin D deficient had a fourfold increased risk.

Some argue that the health benefits of UVB radiation seem to outweigh the adverse effects, and that the risks can be minimized by carefully managing UVR exposure (e.g., by avoiding sunburn), as well as by increasing oneâs intake of dietary antioxidants and limiting dietary fat and caloric intake. Antioxidants including polyphenols, apigenin, curcumin, proanthocyanidins, resveratrol, and silymarin have shown promise in laboratory studies in protecting against UVR-induced skin cancer, perhaps through antimutagenic or immune-modulating mechanisms.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27495</offset><text>Central to the emerging debate is the issue of how to best construct public health messages that highlight the pros and cons of sun exposure in a balanced way.

Moreover, says Patricia Alpert, a nursing professor at the University of Las Vegas, age matters. âThe elderly [have a] declining capacity to make vitamin D,â she says. âMany elderly, especially those living in nursing homes, are vitamin D deficient, [even] those living in areas considered to have adequate sunshine.â</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28169</offset><text>Many experts are now recommending a middle-ground approach that focuses on modest sun exposures.

This is why melatonin is produced during the dark hours and stops upon optic exposure to daylight. This pineal hormone is a key pacesetter for many of the bodyâs circadian rhythms. It also plays an important role in countering infection, inflammation, cancer, and auto-immunity, according to a review in the May 2006 issue of Current Opinion in Investigational Drugs.

Melatonin production also shows a seasonal variation relative to the availability of light, with the hormone produced for a longer period in the winter than in the summer. The melatonin rhythm phase advancement caused by exposure to bright morning light has been effective against insomnia, premenstrual syndrome, and seasonal affective disorder (SAD).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>31087</offset><text>The melatonin precursor, serotonin, is also affected by exposure to daylight. Normally produced during the day, serotonin is only converted to melatonin in darkness. Whereas high melatonin levels correspond to long nights and short days, high serotonin levels in the presence of melatonin reflect short nights and long days (i.e., longer UVR exposure). Moderately high serotonin levels result in more positive moods and a calm yet focused mental outlook. Indeed, SAD has been linked with low serotonin levels during the day as well as with a phase delay in nighttime melatonin production. It was recently found that mammalian skin can produce serotonin and transform it into melatonin, and that many types of skin cells express receptors for both serotonin and melatonin.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>31859</offset><text>With our modern-day penchant for indoor activity and staying up well past dusk, nocturnal melatonin production is typically far from robust. âThe light we get from being outside on a summer day can be a thousand times brighter than weâre ever likely to experience indoors,â says melatonin researcher Russel J. Reiter of the University of Texas Health Science Center. âFor this reason, itâs important that people who work indoors get outside periodically, and moreover that we all try to sleep in total darkness.
