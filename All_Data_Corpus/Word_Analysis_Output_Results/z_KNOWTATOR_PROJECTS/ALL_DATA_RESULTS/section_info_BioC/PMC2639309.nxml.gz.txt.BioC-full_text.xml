Researchers at health promotion research centres in Canada have produced peer-reviewed papers and policy documents based on their work, but no publications have emerged that focus on the specific roles of the health promotion research centres themselves. The purpose of this paper is to propose a framework, based on an in-depth examination of one centre, to help identify the unique roles of health promotion research centres and to clarify the value they add to promoting health and advancing university goals. Considering the shifting federal discourse on health promotion over time and the vulnerability of social and health sciences to changes in research funding priorities, health promotion research centres in Canada and elsewhere may need to articulate their unique roles and contributions in order to maintain a critical focus on health promotion research. The authors briefly describe the Atlantic Health Promotion Research Centre (AHPRC), propose a framework that illustrates six essential roles of health promotion research centres and describe the policy contexts and challenges of health promotion research centres. The analysis of research and knowledge translation activities over 15 years at AHPRC sheds light on the roles that health promotion research centres play in applied research. The conclusion raises questions regarding the value of university-based research centres and challenges to their sustainability.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1713</offset><text>INTRODUCTION</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1726</offset><text>Over the past 20 years, the federal government and universities across Canada have directed resources towards the development of university-based health promotion research centres. In the late 1990s, there were 16 active health promotion research centres in Canada. The centres each took different approaches in terms of focus and governance, and their sustainability has varied across time. However, all were based on the idea of creating linkages between universities, governments and communities to advance health promotion research and the use of research in health-related public policy that supports the promotion of health and the prevention of illness. Researchers at health promotion research centres in Canada have produced peer-reviewed papers and policy documents based on their work, but surprisingly, no publications have emerged that focus on the specific roles of the health promotion research centres themselves.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2656</offset><text>Although university-based research centres, including health promotion research centres, are increasingly being recognized as âsitesâ of expertise, their specific roles in research and knowledge translation have not been clearly articulated. Do university-based research centres have unique contributions to make in understanding and addressing health issues and challenges through health promotion research? Do they assist their host institutions in achieving their goals for research, knowledge translation and student training? Considering the shifting federal landscape of health promotion in Canada, and the vulnerability of social and health sciences to changes in research funding, health promotion research centres in Canada and elsewhere must articulate their unique roles in order to support their sustainability.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3484</offset><text>Not all research centres with public policy objectives have the same purpose and structures, and there is no single model for their evaluation. As an initial step towards understanding the value of research centres, the purpose of this paper is to propose a framework, based on an in-depth examination of one centre, to help clarify the roles and contributions of health promotion research centres. The framework is based on 15 years of experience in health promotion research at the Atlantic Health Promotion Research Centre (AHPRC), Dalhousie University, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. The framework provides a foundation for current and proposed research centres seeking to identify their unique roles and to clarify the value they add to promoting health and advancing university goals. We begin with a brief description of the AHPRC and four examples of Centre projects, followed by the framework, the articulation of Centre roles, and the policy contexts relevant to the work of the Centre. We conclude with a discussion of the value added by health promotion research centres and the challenges to their sustainability.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>4613</offset><text>THE ATLANTIC HEALTH PROMOTION RESEARCH CENTRE</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4659</offset><text>In 1993, the National Health Research Development Program (NHRDP) and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) funded a Centres of Excellence Program which established AHPRC and five other Canadian university-based health promotion research centres. Since then, health promotion research centres in Canada have added value to the achievement of government and university goals individually and through the Canadian Consortium for Health Promotion Research.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5145</offset><text>For the past 15 years, AHPRC has been a site of transdisciplinary and intersectoral collaboration in applied health promotion research. The mission of AHPRC has been to conduct and facilitate health promotion research that influences policy and contributes to the health and well-being of Atlantic Canadians. At AHPRC, researchers, staff and students have worked across disciplines, sectors and geographic distance in projects that are local, regional, national and international in scope. The Centre has generated more than $18 million over 15 years to support the centre operations, and research and knowledge translation projects. Between 1993 and 2007, the Centre Director(s) (the Centre had two Directors over a 15 year period, the first serving from 1993 to 1997 and the second from 1997 to 2006), affiliated researchers, post-doctoral fellows and staff played lead roles in 41 research projects involving universityâgovernmentâcommunity collaborations. In the same time period, the Centre responded to â¼100 requests per year for assistance with health promotion research in the Atlantic region, e.g. identifying funding sources and research partners, reviewing proposals and providing consultation on research plans, budgets and ethics.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6395</offset><text>The initial 5 years of operation of AHPRC demonstrated that communication and collaboration were key aspects of its functioning, and that âtime, trust, ingenuity, resources and well planned strategies [were needed] to facilitate the uptake of health promotion researchâ. The application of research in public policy contexts was thereafter made more explicit in the work of the Centre, focusing on healthy public policy as a key strategy for improving the conditions underlying poor health. The Centre has a strong geographic focus on the four Atlantic Canadian provinces, which have among the highest rates of poor health in the nation, and relatively few resources to address them. Four projects led by collaborations facilitated by AHPRC, presented in TableÂ 1, illustrate the goals, funding sources and budgets typical of AHPRC projects. The number of collaborators in the projects described in TableÂ 1 ranged from 6 to 27, including university, civil society and government collaborators. Examples are drawn from these projects in the sections that follow to demonstrate six essential roles of health promotion research centres.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">DAP001TB1.xml</infon><infon key="id">DAP001TB1</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table_caption</infon><offset>7534</offset><text>Examples of AHPRC projects</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">DAP001TB1.xml</infon><infon key="id">DAP001TB1</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table</infon><infon key="xml">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;

The six roles are framed by the broad policy contexts relevant to health promotion research. Sources of data used to develop the framework included AHPRC annual reports to Dalhousie University Senate, reports to research funders and a synthesis of types of research support provided to researchers by AHPRC over 15 years. The data were analysed and distilled, resulting in the identification of six essential roles. The framework draws on model for the evaluation of research capacity building in health services. Similar to research capacity building in health systems, research capacity building in universities requires a variety of structures and mechanisms to support research development and implementation.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">dap00101.jpg</infon><infon key="id">DAP001F1</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>9761</offset><text>Six essential roles of health promotion research centres.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9819</offset><text>In FigureÂ 1, the six essential roles of health promotion research centres are portrayed as separate, but are in fact highly interdependent.

The presence of a physical space, where people can come together, helps to develop a research culture where âlearning communitiesâ emerge and groups of stakeholders engage as colleagues across formal and social boundaries. The projects portrayed in TableÂ 1 were realized as a function of the AHPRC operational base. The survival of health policy research centres in Canada depends on sustaining an operational base, in part by demonstrating their academic and applied value.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10905</offset><text>The physical infrastructure for AHPRC (office and meeting space) is provided by Dalhousie University. The university also provides administrative support through the university offices of finance, personnel, and research services, library services and salary support for a faculty member who serves as the Centre Director. Between 2001 and 2006, the three core staff at AHPRC were supported by Health Canada and the Departments of Health in the four Atlantic provinces (Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador). Research projects and related activities were financed through external grants acquired from national, regional and provincial funding agencies through competitive peer review processes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>11643</offset><text>AHPRC core staff consists of the Coordinator, Research Consultant and Administrative Assistant.

Over the past decade, there has been an influx of social science researchers into the health promotion field, promoting opportunities for strengthening the theoretical foundations of research on the social determinants of health. At the same time, interdisciplinary and intersectoral research is being required by funding agencies, with the expectation that it will produce more accessible, policy-relevant knowledge.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>13578</offset><text>Representation from a broad range of disciplines and sectors on project teams increases the ability to identify key stakeholders and access a range of resources, e.g. human, financial or informational, and increases the potential for researchers to engage with a broad range of âpolicy shapersâ including policy decision-makers and civil society organizations.

Commitment to projects often fluctuates, and collaborators may revisit project objectives and renew their commitment several times during long-term projects. Adding new members to project teams necessitates their orientation to the project, but also brings new perspectives, skills and linkages. Not all collaborators, notably community collaborators, have the resources needed to participate in research. Research budgets are used to provide support (e.g. travel, accommodations, childcare, computer equipment and honoraria for time spent on project activities) to enable the participation of community collaborators.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>16103</offset><text>Acquiring research funds</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>16128</offset><text>The competition for health research funds in Canada is increasing in intensity. Atlantic Canada has the greatest gaps in research capacity, where resources for research are less abundant than in other parts of the country. Challenges to research development in the region include small numbers of researchers and difficulty recruiting and retaining them (e.g. lower salaries and fewer university supports for research than in other parts of Canada), limited regional funding sources for research, and the challenge of competing for funds at the national level with large, well-resourced institutions. At AHPRC, financial resources have been acquired through a wide variety of funding mechanisms to develop research teams and proposals, to conduct collaborative research projects, to support demonstration projects, to organize international, national, regional and provincial conferences and workshops, to conduct research syntheses and to produce knowledge translation reports, guidelines, workbooks and videos.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>17141</offset><text>In some cases, acquiring new resources for research and the development of healthy public policy was linked to the development of research evidence in AHPRC projects. The Participatory Food Security Projects collected data on the cost of a basic nutritious diet, which led to the allocation of provincial funds to support annual food costing and to develop a food security lens for policy decision-makers. The Yarmouth Stroke Project contributed to the decision to commit municipal and provincial funds to address gaps in services for people who have had a stroke and their caregivers, e.g. establishment of integrated stroke care at the regional hospital and development of a provincial stroke strategy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>17846</offset><text>Similarly, spin-off projects were often carried out by leveraging funds from large research grants. The Rural Communities Impacting Policy Project leveraged funds for a project on volunteer engagement in the management of small harbours, and for a project that provided a policy entrepreneur to work on the issue of recruiting and retaining health professionals in rural communities, among others. The momentum established through collaboration in the Participatory Food Security Projects was sustained over the development, funding and implementation of seven projects housed at AHPRC between 2001 and 2006, and policy-related work continued beyond this time frame to generate research and influence policy at provincial and national levels. Substantial in-kind contributions from government and civil society organizations are also mobilized through collaborative research. Staff at AHPRC monitor research funding sources and trends, enabling the Centre to quickly bring together teams and prepare proposals when funding opportunities are announced.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>18898</offset><text>Project management and consultation</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>18934</offset><text>Research centres provide a venue for group research and play an essential role in developing and managing the physical, financial and human resources associated with large-scale research projects.

Time and resources for student training are built into all AHPRC projects. The Rural Communities Impacting Policy Project included a research internship programme through which students were supported by faculty and community collaborators to conduct community-based research on issues identified by rural community organizations. Between 1993 and 2007, 85 students were employed at AHPRC through research assistantships and internships, and students have completed undergraduate and graduate thesis research in conjunction with Centre projects. Students trained at AHPRC have gone on to pursue graduate and post-graduate studies in health promotion and related fields and to assume positions in provincial and federal health promotion and public health departments and agencies, university research services and the non-profit sector. Students and post-doctoral fellows benefit from an approach that goes beyond the single academic supervisor model to encompass learning from a group of highly skilled researchers and collaborators.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>21989</offset><text>The AHPRC Director, Coordinator and Research Consultant frequently engage in mentoring other university and community-based researchers both formally (through workshops) and informally (through meetings, e-mail and telephone).

In the shifting political discourse related to health promotion in Canada, the language of âpopulation healthâ is threatening to replace the terms health promotion and public health. Where the application of research is concerned, despite Canada's preeminence in the field of health promotion, health promotion remains a âpoor cousinâ in the allocation of federal resources.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26509</offset><text>An increasing emphasis on evidence-based decision-making in medicine and other health-related disciplines has created an unprecedented focus on using research to support decision-making in health services and public policy in Canada.

Research funding agencies such as the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada and the Canadian Health Services Research Foundation have developed programmes that reflect this new modality of research.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27140</offset><text>Research funding has historically favoured the more prestigious âpureâ sciences that use randomized control trials. Changing trends in funding, such as the emergence of communityâuniversity partnership funding programs, e.g. the Community University Research Alliances (CURA) programme within the SSHRC, have helped to improve the credibility of applied research. âPartnerships enhance the credibility and ownership of research among users, promoting its uptakeâ.

The level of collaboration required for applied research and knowledge translation is not rewarded in tenure and promotion systems in academia in the same way as more traditional academic pursuits. University policies and supports for applied research are improving, but the value accorded to the time and effort spent on collaboration has not kept pace with the increasing demand for applied health research.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>28307</offset><text>One challenge for health promotion research centres is the broad range of potential public policy areas where health promotion research could be used, including policy related to the social determinants of health and illness/injury prevention. The project goals outlined in TableÂ 1 reflect the generally rural, and relatively economically disadvantaged, character of the population in Atlantic Canada. Policy contexts influencing research use include the formulation of public policies to support rural health and sustainability, including rural economic and community development, rural health systems and both food access and food supply determinants of food security. Research-informed public policies at multiple levelsâfederal, provincial and municipalâare needed to improve the conditions underlying poor health in the region.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>29145</offset><text>Health promotion research centres also have critical roles to play in global health. The prevention of chronic illness, a longstanding goal of health promotion, is critically needed as chronic illness is now the main cause of both death and disability worldwide. Health promotion research and knowledge translation must play a major role in understanding and addressing the prevention of chronic illness through strategies such as healthy public policy and supportive environments. However, the translation of research into action clearly depends on sustained research and knowledge translation efforts within regions, countries and through international collaboration. Lone researchers working within the boundaries of typical granting agencies on small health promotion studies are not sufficient to examine and impact the chronic illness âwaveâ currently taking place across the world. Incubation and development of effective social-health strategies can develop within a strong research centre infrastructure that supports such efforts. The international health promotion research community must move beyond small, âone-off'sâ to critically examine the nature of research infrastructure necessary to become central players in the global battle against chronic illness.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>30426</offset><text>DISCUSSION</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>30437</offset><text>Current trends in research funding for health and social sciences in Canada have created an environment in which the kind of roles played by research centres are essential for meeting the research requirements for population health, satisfying the requirements of funding programmes for collaborative research, and fostering the advancement of health promotion. The analysis of research and knowledge translation activities over 15 years at AHPRC sheds light on six essential roles that the Centre plays in research and knowledge translation in Atlantic Canada. Other research centres may benefit from conducting a similar analysis of their roles. Are the roles identified for AHPRC similar to those played by other health promotion research centres? Are these roles applicable to other types of university-based research centres (e.g. health or social policy centres)? Are some roles more important in health promotion research centres than in other types of research centres (e.g. collaboration)?</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>31436</offset><text>Health promotion research centres provide a foundation for sustained focus in specific research areas, sustained relationships between research collaborators, and training sites that facilitate advances in health promotion research. They also add substantial value to universities through acquiring external funds; attracting students, post-doctoral fellows and faculty interested in health promotion research; and developing a culture that supports collaborative, applied research. Research centres may generate as much as one-third of the external research funds brought into universities, making them an investment that has yet to be fully realized.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>32089</offset><text>Health promotion research centres face a number of significant challenges to their sustainability, including shifting political discourses and reduced resources at the federal level for health promotion research. In a political climate of âevidence-based decision-makingâ, health promotion cannot offer the kinds of cause-and-effect research outcomes that are valued in the âhardâ sciences.

The constant pursuit of funds can lead to âmission driftâ, whereby funds may be pursued in areas that do not fit well with centre objectives but allow for continuing centre operations and maintaining staff.
