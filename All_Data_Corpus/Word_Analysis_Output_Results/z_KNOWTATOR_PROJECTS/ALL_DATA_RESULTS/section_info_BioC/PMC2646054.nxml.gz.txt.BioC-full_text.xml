Low birth weight is also associated with an increased risk for certain chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension. One proposed explanation linking low birth weight to chronic diseases is the Barker âthrifty phenotypeâ hypothesis, which postulates that the lack of adequate nutrients in the intrauterine environment âprogramsâ the offspring for survival in a nutrient-poor world. It follows that if the actual postnatal environment is not nutrient poor but instead nutrient rich, metabolic pathways will have been âmalprogrammed,â leading to adult-onset metabolic syndrome diseases, including atherosclerosis and diabetes. A great deal of evidence now supports the Barker hypothesis; therefore, current research in humans and in animal models is focused on specific mechanisms for in utero programming.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2648</offset><text>Many types of maternal stresses in different animal models have been used to produce intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). In the current study, we used two mouse models of IUGR, one using maternal protein restriction to examine increased adiposity and glucose intolerance end points, and one using a high-cholesterol maternal environment in LDLRâ/â mice to examine cardiovascular end points. Previous work using the rat model has shown that maternal protein restriction results in offspring with IUGR, low muscle mass, adult-onset glucose intolerance, hypertension, and early aging. Maternal effects of a low-protein diet included a significant decrease in the placental protein 11 Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, an enzyme that protects the fetus from maternal glucocorticoids. A concomitant increase in glucocorticoid-inducible enzymes was found in the fetuses of dams on a low-protein diet. Studies examining maternal programming for atherosclerosis have found a significant association between maternal hypercholesterolemia and increased atherosclerotic lesions in the offspring in newborn and adult rabbits, in adult mice, and in human fetuses and children. Existing evidence for in utero programming from hypercholesterolemia includes increased maternal oxidative stress and an altered adaptive immune response to oxidized LDL. Although IUGR itself is associated with an increased risk for atherosclerosis in humans, high maternal cholesterol in humans has not been established as causative for IUGR. Using a rabbit model, however, it was shown that a moderate 0.2% cholesterol, low-fat chow gestational diet resulted in litters with IUGR. The decreased birth weight was associated with an excessive accumulation of lipids in the placenta, suggesting possible interference with nutrient transport to the fetus.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4473</offset><text>Because maternal protein restriction and hypercholesterolemia both create an abnormal maternal metabolic environment, we hypothesized that there may be a common disruption of metabolic pathways affecting the offspring.

We then looked for commonalities in the experimental dams to identify possible pathways for the developmental origins of metabolic syndrome diseases. In both models, the dams had decreased levels of certain essential amino acids.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>5072</offset><text>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>5100</offset><text>Animal husbandry.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5118</offset><text>This study was approved by the UCLA Animal Research Committee and was performed in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the use of experimental animals.

On detection of a vaginal plug at the end of this 2-h period, designated as day 0 of gestation, females were placed on either a 9% protein-restricted diet (low protein) or a control diet containing 19% protein. Pregnant females underwent cesarean section on gestational day 19. Females were deeply anesthetized with 2% isoflurane, and after cervical dislocation, cesarean section was performed under a heat lamp with aseptic technique. Pups were weighed and cross-fostered to a postpartum FVB/J mother to equalize the postpartum environment of both groups. The pups were delivered by cesarean section because our previous attempts to generate IUGR in mice via protein restriction were unsuccessful secondary to cannibalization of the pups by the mother. The range in age of the dams was from 2 to 4.5 months because the females were old enough to breed at 2 months but not so old that confounders, such as reduced litter size, may have occurred. Because the dams cannibalized many first litters, necessitating the change to cesarean section births and fostering, some of the offspring were from second litters. There were no statistical differences between the birth weights, litter sizes, or adult phenotypes between first and second litters; therefore, we combined the litters with the same in utero exposure. For low-protein birth weight comparisons, seven low-protein and seven control litters were evaluated. At 1 week of age, pups were weighed again, and the litter culled to six. Fostered pups were weaned at 4 weeks of age into cages of four animals, separated by sex and maternal environment (low-protein vs. control). The protein-restricted litters were not measured for atherosclerotic lesion size in adulthood because wild-type C57BL/6 mice do not develop lesions on a chow low-cholesterol diet.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>8146</offset><text>Hypercholesterolemia studies.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8176</offset><text>LDLRâ/â females were placed on chow diet or high-fat, moderate-cholesterol diet (Western diet) for 6 weeks and subsequently bred with LDLRâ/â males maintained on chow. LDLRâ/â mice had plasma cholesterol concentrations of â¼250 mg/dl on a standard chow diet, which represented the control cholesterol environment. On a Western diet, the LDLRâ/â mice had cholesterol concentrations up to 1,000 mg/dl, which represented the experimental high-cholesterol environment. The progeny of LDLRâ/â females on a chow diet or Western diet constituted the LDLRâ/â control or Western offspring, respectively. Fasting plasma cholesterol concentrations were determined for both sets of LDLRâ/â females before breeding, and the LDLRâ/â offspring delivered vaginally were fostered at birth. Four hypercholesterolemia litters and two control litters were evaluated. The pups were weaned and separated by sex and maternal diet at 4 weeks of age. The offspring of both LDLRâ/â control and Western-diet litters were fed a chow diet on weaning. Initially the LDLRâ/â Western offspring exhibited a very low survival rate (â¼1 pup in an 8-pup litter survived) compared with LDLRâ/â control offspring (6â7 pups survived per 8-pup litter). However, fostering the pups at birth equalized the survival rates for both groups. An important study by Napoli et al. demonstrated a maternal-diet effect on lesion size at 90 days in LDLRâ/â mice offspring. This time point was therefore chosen for the current study. After an overnight fast, LDLRâ/â adult offspring were deeply anesthetized with 2% isoflurane and weighed, blood was collected by retro-orbital sinus puncture, tissues were harvested after cervical dislocation, and gonadal fat pads were dissected and weighed.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>9972</offset><text>Maternal plasma amino acid analysis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10009</offset><text>Maternal plasma amino acid analysis was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography at Baylor University Medical Center Institute of Metabolic Diseases (http://www.baylorhealth.edu/imd/).

In our study, the IUGR male offspring of protein-restricted dams became glucose intolerant with increased adiposity compared with controls. IUGR low-protein females did not differ significantly from controls in glucose tolerance and maintained a lower growth curve throughout.

First, a sex difference in weight gain and glucose intolerance was seen in the low-protein model. Males, but not females, caught up in weight to the control offspring by the eighth week of age and developed glucose intolerance by 32 weeks of age. This sex difference has been found in other mouse models, including a recent investigation of heterozygous GLUT3-null mice. Also, in a transgenic mouse model of the hypothalamic-expressed regulator for food intake, neuropeptide Y receptor 1, a sex effect was seen. NPYR1 transgenic males, but not females, gained excess weight on a high-fat diet and lost weight with the administration of leptin. Thus, the sex difference that we saw in weight gain, adiposity, and glucose tolerance in the low-protein group is consistent with other findings and indicates the likely participation of the endocrine system in the etiology of these traits.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>21218</offset><text>Contrasting with the outcomes for low-protein offspring, LDLRâ/â Western-diet progeny in our study did not catch up with controls in weight or in adiposity by the 90-day time point that was chosen for evaluation of atherosclerotic lesions. Several explanations for this might be considered, including 1) that these IUGR mice require &gt;3 months to catch up with controls, or 2) that a combination of a high-fat diet and hypercholesterolemia programmed the offspring differently for metabolism and weight gain in adulthood. A high-fat maternal diet in rats was recently shown to prevent excess weight gain in adulthood. Based on tracking of food intake, this study provided evidence that the high-fat in utero diet likely programmed the offspring to metabolize or use energy less efficiently, preventing them from gaining excess weight in adulthood. Therefore, the absence of excess adiposity and weight gain in the hypercholesterolemia IUGR offspring in the current study could be due to hypothalamic programming via the high-fat maternal diet. Although the LDLRâ/â Western diet IUGR litters may have eventually led to excess weight gain and glucose intolerance at an advanced age, other experiments have shown that the chow diet does not produce these end points in B6 LDLRâ/â mice by 90 days of age. Instead, a high-fat diet was necessary to bring about these metabolic syndrome traits in LDLRâ/â mice at this time point. We purposely used a chow diet in the current study to establish that increased atherosclerosis in the offspring was due to in utero programming. The effect of programming on offspring may extend into the second generation: A recent high-fat diet programming study using mice showed that a high-fat diet leading to obesity during gestation produced glucose intolerance in both the first and second generations of offspring.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>23079</offset><text>Hypoaminoacidemia in our hypercholesterolemic model could possibly have resulted from reduced protein absorption, reduced amino acid availability via altered metabolism in the dams, or reduced protein consumption due to the high caloric content of the Western diet. The Western and control diets used in our study were 17.3 and 18.6% by weight protein, a difference that would be unlikely to produce the significant reduction of certain amino acids in the LDLRâ/â Western-diet dams. Reduced food intake because of the higher percentage of calories supplied by fat in the Western (42%) versus chow (18%) diets could have led to an overall reduction of protein intake. However, if that were the case, all essential amino acids would probably have been reduced on the Western diet, which they were not. Furthermore, the essential amino acid lysine was lower in LDLRâ/â dams on the Western diet than controls but was higher in the protein-restricted dams compared with controls. Thus, the Western and low-protein diets do not necessarily lead to a reduction of all essential amino acids, indicating other factors besides dietary intake of protein as causative for the hypoaminoacidemia in the dams. The lower urea content in the plasma of low-protein dams was expected because less protein consumption would result in less urea generated as a byproduct of protein catabolism. The lower urea content in the plasma of hypercholesterolemic dams was another indication of less protein accretion in these animals.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>24592</offset><text>Previous studies have observed a correlation between high maternal cholesterol concentrations and enhanced lesions of atherosclerosis in the offspring in rabbits and in LDLRâ/â mice. Maternal oxidative stress in a high cholesterol environment may adversely affect the placenta and may directly or indirectly enhance atherosclerotic lesions in the offspring. Experiments in hypercholesterolemic rabbits have shown that administration of the antioxidant vitamin E during pregnancy resulted in reduced atherosclerotic lesions in the offspring, indicating that maternal oxidative stress likely plays a role in maternal programming for atherosclerosis. However, given the complexity of metabolic syndrome traits, it is also likely that more than one physiological pathway is involved. The placentas of women who gave birth to IUGR babies were found to have decreased placental leucine transport and decreased placental mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity. Similarly, the IUGR litters in our study were associated with reductions in essential maternal amino acids, including leucine; therefore, hypoaminoacidemia in the dams may have resulted in reduced levels of fetal amino acids, resulting in metabolic malprogramming of the fetal hypothalamus. mTOR, a kinase that is upregulated by leucine, regulates cell-cycle progression and growth throughout the body by sensing changes in energy status. Downstream from the leptin receptor, mTOR is also involved in energy homeostasis and metabolism. Because leucine via mTOR regulation has been shown to participate in muscle formation in fetal sheep and pancreatic Î²-cell function in a cell culture system, downregulation of mTOR by a decrease in leucine, both in hypercholesterolemic and protein-restricted in utero environments, could play a role in IUGR and in malprogramming of the fetal hypothalamus, leading to the previously described âthrifty phenotype.â</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>26512</offset><text>It is becoming increasingly apparent that embryonic and fetal cells have a complex system integrating nutritional signals from their environment to maximize the potential for survival. The association of maternal malnutrition and IUGR leading to adult-onset metabolic disorders, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and atherosclerosis, has been demonstrated in several epidemiological studies. Our results mimicked population studies in humans where maternal malnutrition and the resultant low birth weight were identified as the common risk factors for adult-onset diseases. In addition, our studies demonstrated that maternal protein restriction and hypercholesterolemia were both associated with maternal hypoaminoacidemia. Therefore, maternal hypoaminoacidemia may be an important antecedent in both models of IUGR and may be an important link in the mechanisms that contribute to adult-onset glucose intolerance, obesity, and atherosclerosis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">SUPPL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>27458</offset><text>Supplementary Material</text></passage><passage><infon
