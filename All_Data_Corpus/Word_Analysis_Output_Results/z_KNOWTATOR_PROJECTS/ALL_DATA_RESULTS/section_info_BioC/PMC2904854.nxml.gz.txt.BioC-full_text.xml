This study sought to understand how drug use and factors associated with drug use influence womenâs prenatal care use. A total of 20 semi-structured interviews and 2 focus groups were conducted with a racially/ethnically diverse sample of low-income women using alcohol and drugs in a California county. Women using drugs attend and avoid prenatal care for reasons not connected to their drug use: concern for the health of their baby, social support, and extrinsic barriers such as health insurance and transportation. Drug use itself is a barrier for a few women. In addition to drug use, women experience multiple simultaneous risk factors. Both the drug use and the multiple simultaneous risk factors make resolving extrinsic barriers more difficult. Women also fear the effects of drug use on their babyâs health and fear being reported to Child Protective Services, each of which influence womenâs prenatal care use. Increasing the number of pregnant women who use drugs who receive prenatal care requires systems-level rather than only individual-level changes. These changes require a paradigm shift to viewing drug use in context of the person and society and acceptance of responsibility for unintended consequences of public health bureaucratic procedures and messages about effects of drug use during pregnancy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1501</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1514</offset><text>Pregnant women who use drugs are over-represented among women who receive late, limited, and no prenatal care. Similar to pregnant women in general, women who use drugs and receive adequate prenatal care generally have better pregnancy outcomes than women who use drugs and do not receive adequate care. It is unclear whether these improvements are due to prenatal care or if lack of prenatal care is a proxy for other risk factors associated with poor outcomes. Nevertheless, lack of prenatal care clearly limits opportunities for offering other health promoting interventions.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2093</offset><text>The limited research suggests that women who use drugs during pregnancy face the following barriers to prenatal care: difficulties with transportation and health insurance, âdrug lifestyleâ, fear of having drug use identified by providers, and fear of legal repercussions, including Child Protective Services (CPS) reports. In addition, a recent study examined whether drug use itself or factors associated with drug use are barriers. The study found that both drug use and factors associated with drug use are barriers, although this differs depending on the specific drug.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2672</offset><text>The existing research primarily tests researchersâ a priori hypotheses. Thus, it may exclude some key barriers. In addition, it has focused on determining the most common barriers and on determining which risk factors explain the most variance in limited prenatal care. While each are important, they do not provide information on how drug use or factors associated with drug use become barriers to prenatal care. With the goal of informing interventions to reduce barriers to prenatal care for women who use drugs during pregnancy, this qualitative study identifies womenâs perspectives on barriers to prenatal care and seeks to understand the processes through which drug use and factors associated with drug use during pregnancy become barriers.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>3425</offset><text>Methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3433</offset><text>This exploratory qualitative research was conducted between September and December 2006 in a northern California county. The county has a population of just over one million people, and is diverse in terms of race/ethnicity, income, and rural/urban status. Goals were to identify barriers to prenatal care and factors that encourage use of prenatal care by pregnant women who use alcohol and/or drugs and engage women in identifying strategies to reduce barriers. Human Subjects approval was obtained from University of California, Berkeley and informed consent was obtained from each participant.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4031</offset><text>Women with current alcohol and/or drug use or a history of substance abuse who were pregnant or had a child 2Â years old or younger were eligible and were recruited from substance abuse treatment, a home-visiting program, and the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Program. Staff at these sites recruited women through a standardized script and posted flyers. Women then self-identified to the lead investigator (first author) either by phone or when she was onsite at the agency/organization. The intention of this purposive sampling strategy was to find pregnant women and new mothers who were currently using alcohol and/or drugs or had a history of alcohol and/or drug use during pregnancy who could talk about challenges that pregnant women who use alcohol and/or drugs face in entering and continuing prenatal care. Despite our intention of including women who used alcohol only, both alcohol and drugs, and drugs only, our sample only includes women using drugs, either alone or in combination with alcohol. It does not include women using alcohol without drugs.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5101</offset><text>Thirty-eight women participated. Twenty semi-structured interviews and two focus groups (with eight and ten women each) were conducted. About one half of interview participants (nÂ =Â 11) and all focus group participants were recruited from treatment. Interview and focus group guides addressed: womenâs thoughts about and experiences with prenatal care; barriers and facilitators to prenatal care for women who use alcohol and/or drugs; and womenâs thoughts about how the health department and health care providers could encourage women who use alcohol and drugs to enter prenatal care earlier, including ideas for a community awareness campaign. Women were also asked close-ended questions about demographics, timing of entry to prenatal care, and type of substance (alcohol and/or which drug) they used. Focus group participants provided this information in exit surveys. Due to an error with exit survey printing, women in focus groups were not asked questions about timing of prenatal care entry. The questions about alcohol and drug use were used to classify participants as using alcohol only, alcohol and drugs, or drugs only. Women were treated as study participants, key informants, and collaborators in community awareness campaign development. Women who were not pregnant at study participation (74%) were asked about their most recent pregnancy.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6465</offset><text>Interviews and focus groups lasted approximately 60 and 90Â  min, respectively and were recorded on audiocassette.

We had some general ideas of the barriers women might report prior to initiating the study. However, we did not have an a-priori coding scheme. Initial codes were developed in an inductive process based on the first nine interview and both focus group transcripts. Codes were then added and refined based on the remaining eleven interviews. A codebook was created and then used to code the entire set of interview and focus group transcripts. Memos were used during coding to track ongoing analysis insights and after coding was completed to explore different aspects of identified themes and determine the number and quality of quotations supporting themes and different aspects of themes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7638</offset><text>Case-studies, a cross-case study, and typology were also used. Case studies of each interview participant were created to document the timing of prenatal care entry in relation to drug use cessation and factors that facilitated or hindered prenatal care entry. A cross-case study using data from all interview participants then categorized each woman based on her trimester of prenatal care entry and timing of drug use cessation. Health insurance status and previous CPS involvement emerged as themes and were added to the cross-case study. Timing of prenatal care entry, timing of drug use cessation, and structural barriers were then graphed to explore the relationships between timing of each behavior and structural barriers. Fisherâs exact tests were used to test (1) whether problems with health insurance were associated with entry after first trimester and (2) whether entering after first trimester and/or having stopped use before entering were associated with previous CPS involvement. The statistical significance of the second test differed depending on whether the denominator was restricted to only those with at least one child prior to the index pregnancy; however, the trend was in the same direction for both. Findings from the full sample are reported. Finally, women were categorized based on how they responded to common fears, such as fears of being reported to CPS. For example, a typology was created based on subthemes of similarities and differences in ways that women respond to their fears of being reported to CPS in relation to prenatal care.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9215</offset><text>Validity checks included (1) respondent validation, where initial findings were shared with other women similar to initial participants, staff at agencies where participants were recruited, providers, and policymakers and feedback requested; (2) field time of more than 3Â years that the lead investigator spent in the study setting; (3) use of multiple methods of data collection (interviews and focus groups) to triangulate findings relating to barriers to and facilitators of prenatal care; and (4) checks of how supported a key finding relating to fear of CPS was both across and within interviews. This final check was conducted after coding was completed to ensure that our finding was not driven by only one or two interviews.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>9949</offset><text>Results</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>9957</offset><text>Sample Description</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9976</offset><text>Participants were a racially and ethnically diverse sample of 38 low-income English-speaking pregnant and parenting women.

Five percent (nÂ =Â 1) received no prenatal care. Most women used more than one substance. Methamphetamine (61% nÂ =Â 23) and crack/cocaine (16% nÂ =Â 6) were the most common primary substances. Many used alcohol (42% nÂ =Â 16), but none reported an âalcohol onlyâ pattern of use.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>10755</offset><text>âSame Reasons Somebody Whoâs Not Using Goesâ</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10806</offset><text>[Prenatal care] affects a baby a lot.

Multiple simultaneous barriers seemed to make resolving extrinsic barriers more difficult. For example, obtaining health insurance was especially difficult for one homeless woman. She reported:Some women saw drug use as related to and even as causing some extrinsic barriers. For example, one woman reported having been with a boyfriend in another town using drugs and not having her own transportation to get to prenatal appointments. Other women talked about how drug use left them with few resources, which then made it difficult to resolve the barriers. As one explained:Resolving bureaucratic barriers took persistence and determination. Drug use made resolving bureaucratic barriers more difficult because of both competing priorities and system gaps. Drug use itself, the stress of reducing or managing drug use, and the stress of leaving abusive partners with whom women used drugs were factors that women described as making it difficult to prioritize resolving bureaucratic barriers. Some women also reported having unique concerns or situations related to their drug use that conflict with bureaucratic procedures. For example, a few women mentioned drug-related paranoia. One woman explained how this paranoia made it difficult to complete forms in public places.Other women mentioned delays in discovering pregnancy. Some saw these delays as due, in part, to drug use. These delays led to them to begin obtaining insurance and scheduling appointments later in pregnancy. Starting these processes later created additional barriers, especially with scheduling appointments. </text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_3</infon><offset>17879</offset><text>Drug Use and Social Support</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>17907</offset><text>The lady across the street [from my parents], actually, our neighbor, who was the administrator at [local hospital], she, at one point, probably was the one that told my mom, look at Medi-Cal.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>18100</offset><text>It was the first couple of days I was [at the treatment program] and there was a pregnant girl there that told me âcause I had been tryinâ to get the Medi-Cal straightened out.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>18281</offset><text>My boyfriend kind of went the extra mile for me.

Some took steps to hide drug use and pregnancy from family and non-using partners, making it difficult to obtain support.Other women reported that when they reduced or stopped drug use, they lost access to drug-using friends and partners who wanted them to continue to use drugs with them.

In addition, both drug use and factors associated with drug use influence prenatal care use. Drug use itself is a reason a few women do not attend prenatal care. However, for most women, drug use became a barrier to prenatal care by interacting with additional individual, interpersonal, systems, and policy-level factors. First, as has been found previously, pregnant women who use drugs face multiple barriers. Experiencing multiple barriers simultaneously makes resolving each barrier more difficult. They also may be especially at risk for certain bureaucratic barriers, such as finding doctors willing to start seeing women during their third trimester. Second, women believe that drug use during pregnancy is very harmful to the fetus. While a motivator to attend prenatal care for some women, this belief appears to scare other women to the point that they delay entering prenatal care. Womenâs beliefs are consistent with some public health messages about effects of drug use during pregnancy. It is important to note that recent research suggests that drug use during pregnancy may not be as harmful as women believe and public health messages suggest. Third, women report isolation from potentially supportive networks due to their drug use during pregnancy. These same messages may stigmatize women who use drugs during pregnancy. This stigma appears to isolate women from social networks that could facilitate prenatal care use. Finally, as suggested by ACOG and found by other qualitative, but not quantitative research, fear of CPS reports is a common and significant barrier. Fear of CPS reports may be warranted based on current policy and practice. While drug use itself is a factor for some women, it does not appear that late or limited prenatal care among women who use drugs is caused solely by drug use itself. Rather, late or limited prenatal care may be better understood as one rational response to public health messages and CPS reporting practices, and as an indicator of systems-gaps.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>27385</offset><text>These findings should be interpreted in light of the studyâs limitations. First, the sample is a small non-representative sample of agency-involved women in one county. Second, few participants were using drugs at the time of participation and many were or had been involved with CPS, each of which may have influenced what they chose to focus on during interviews and focus groups. Third, the assessment of alcohol and drug use only included questions about type of substance and did not include quantity/frequency questions or questions about problem severity, which limits generalizability. However, the questions asked suggest that findings apply to women who use methamphetamine or cocaine, either alone or in combination with marijuana, alcohol, and other drugs; and may not generalize to women using opiates or using marijuana only, because they were not represented in the sample. However, more research with better alcohol/drug measures is needed to confirm these findings and to determine whether women with more or less frequent use or more or less severe problems experience the same barriers. Fourth, other counties may respond differently to drug use during pregnancy and may have different systems, such as easier third-trimester entry to care or services to assist homeless women obtain insurance. Finally, the direction of causality between drug use and extrinsic barriers is not possible to determine. While some participants spoke of their drug use as causing the barriers, it is possible that any association between the two is not a simple uni-directional causal relationship and that each indicate higher risks from more distal factors.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>29046</offset><text>This study also has strengths. Findings are largely consistent with prior research on barriers to prenatal care for pregnant women who use drugs. However, this research also extends previous research by (1) identifying new barriers that have not been previously documentedâfear of the effects of drug use and isolation from social networks; (2) finding additional support that fear of CPS is a barrier; (3) identifying how drug use becomes a barrier; and (4) regardless of the direction of causality, describing ways in which multiple simultaneous barriers make it more difficult to resolve barriers. This study also extends previous research by identifying systems-level barriers, including those related to public health bureaucratic procedures, messages, and CPS reporting policies/practices, rather than solely focusing on individual-level risk factors.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>29906</offset><text>Conclusions</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>29918</offset><text>Findings suggest that reducing the number of pregnant women who use alcohol and drugs who receive late or limited prenatal care requires more than telling women to stop drug use. It requires acknowledging the complexity of womenâs decision-making about prenatal care, the diversity among women who use drugs during pregnancy, and a focus on changing systems and not solely getting women to change. Some interventions that may increase prenatal care utilization are: (1) new messages about the effects of drug use during pregnancy that identify steps that pregnant women who have already used drugs can take to increase chances of having healthy babies; (2) clarified CPS reporting policies; (3) streamlined insurance applications; and (4) easier access to providers who accept women in their third trimesters. Addressing these systems-level barriers as opposed to focusing on drug use as an isolated and silver-bullet risk factor will require a paradigm shift to viewing drug use and prenatal care utilization in the context of multiple interacting risk factors and social environment. It will also require increased recognition that public health messages and bureaucratic procedures can create barriers and acceptance of responsibility for unintended and potentially iatrogenic consequences of these messages and procedures.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>31247</offset><text>References</text></passage><passage><infon key="fpage">283</infon><infon key="issue">3</infon><infon key="lpage">288</infon><infon key="name_0">surname:Melnikow;given-names:J</infon><infon key="name_1">surname:Alemagno;given-names:SA</infon><infon key="name_2">surname:Rottman;given-names:C</infon><infon key="name_3">surname:Zyzanski;given-names:SJ</infon><infon key="pub-id_pmid">2002319</infon><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="source">Journal of Family Practice</infon><infon key="type">ref</infon><infon key="volume">32</infon><infon key="year">1991</infon><offset>31258</offset><text>Characteristics of inner-city women giving birth with little or no prenatal care: A case-control study</text></passage><passage><infon key="fpage">1584</infon><infon key="issue">12</infon><infon key="lpage">1590</infon><infon key="name_0">surname:Kelly;given-names:RH</infon><infon key="name_1">surname:Danielsen;given-names:BH</infon><infon key="name_2">surname:Golding;given-names:JM</infon><infon key="name_3">surname:Anders;given-names:TF</infon><infon key="name_4">surname:Gilbert;given-names:WM</infon><infon key="name_5">surname:Zatzick;given-names:DF</infon><infon key="pub-id_pmid">10577877</infon><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="source">Psychiatric Services</infon><infon key="type">ref</infon><infon key="volume">50</infon><infon key="year">1999</infon><offset>31361</offset><text>Adequacy of prenatal care among women with psychiatric diagnoses giving birth in California in 1994 and 1995</text></passage><passage><infon key="fpage">1276</infon><infon key="issue">8</infon><infon key="lpage">1286</infon><infon key="name_0">surname:Hankin;given-names:J</infon><infon key="name_1">surname:McCaul;given-names:ME</infon><infon key="name_2">surname:Heussner;given-names:J</infon><infon key="pub-id_doi">10.1111/j.1530-0277.2000.tb02094.x</infon><infon key="pub-id_pmid">10968668</infon><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="source">Alcoholism, Clinical and Experimental Research</infon><infon key="type">ref</infon><infon key="volume">24</infon><infon key="year">2000</infon><offset>31470</offset><text>Pregnant, alcohol-abusing women</text></passage><passage><infon key="fpage">56</infon><infon key="issue">2</infon><infon key="lpage">64</infon><infon key="name_0">surname:Pagnini;given-names:DL</infon><infon key="name_1">surname:Reichman;given-names:NE</infon><infon key="pub-id_doi">10.2307/2648213</infon><infon key="pub-id_pmid">10779236</infon><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="source">Family Planning Perspectives</infon><infon key="type">ref</infon><infon key="volume">32</infon><infon key="year">2000</infon><offset>31502</offset><text>Psychosocial factors and the timing of prenatal care among women in New Jerseyâs Health Start program</text></passage><passage><infon key="fpage">45</infon><infon key="issue">1</infon><infon key="lpage">50</infon><infon key="name_0">surname:Maupin;given-names:R;suffix:Jr</infon><infon key="name_1">surname:Lyman;given-names:R</infon><infon key="name_2">surname:Fatsis;given-names:J</infon><infon key="pub-id_doi">10.1080/14767050412331283913</infon><infon key="pub-id_pmid">15370082</infon><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="source">The Journal of Maternal-Fetal &amp;
