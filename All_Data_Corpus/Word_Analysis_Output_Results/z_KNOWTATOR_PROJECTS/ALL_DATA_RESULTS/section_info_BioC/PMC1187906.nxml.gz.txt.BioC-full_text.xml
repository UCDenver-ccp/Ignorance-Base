By contrast, likelihood for obesity or imbalance increases with rising income when that last dollar is earned without certainty that it is available for discretionary spending.

Which specific families are affected, however, is highly dependent on micro-social factors in the family related to how well resources are used in the proximal or microsocial environment. For the casual observer, failure to nurture and nourish children within the microsocial environment characteristic of poverty is seen as the cause rather than the consequence of poverty. This view fails to recognize that for the poor, behavior is shaped by the power of a macrosocial environment they are unable to change, distal from the experiences of children and family. Choices that seem irrational or even self-destructive from the perspective of those living outside such a powerful environment may seem perfectly appropriate and effective from within. </text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2393</offset><text>We suggest that in the United States and other developed countries, a lack of discretionary income affects food choices and ultimately nutritional status.

Food preferences formed in childhood last a lifetime and affect the likelihood of malnutrition occurring. Thus, in the context of chronic poverty, what we see as &quot;food choice&quot; is a highly complex phenomenon influenced by the cost and availability of food and the dynamics of the family. On a positive note, the body of Mead's work, and that of her contemporaries suggest that a combination of education, persistence, readily available, affordable and culturally consistent food is likely to have a positive impact on the nutritional status of children in poor families. It is necessary, however, to have a secure food supply. </text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>5522</offset><text>The impact of poverty on nutritional status</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5566</offset><text>With chronic poverty, a process called the &quot;Engel's Phenomenon&quot; occurs. Food selection narrows to those items providing the most energy at lowest cost. Over time, micronutrients disappear from the diet, and specific nutrient deficiencies follow. For families living well below the poverty level, increasing income does increase discretionary spending. Any money received is used to pay the cost of necessities â food, rent, heat, and the expenses of getting to work such as clothes, day-care, and transportation. Nothing is left to improve nutritional quality of the diet or, at lowest income, provide sufficient caloric intake. Thus, there is a paradoxical association between poverty and obesity in childhood. As shown by Hofferth and Curtin with data from Panel Study of Income Dynamics Child Development Supplement of 1999, leanness is the rule (a 12% incidence of obesity) for families living below poverty level. (24) Twenty two percent of children living in families with incomes from one to three times poverty level are likely to be obese. Past three times poverty income, the incidence among children diminishes to the 12 % level again. An important difference, however, is that impoverishment increases the risk for micronutrient deficiency. </text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6822</offset><text>Studies throughout the United States show that competing costs for other necessities â rent and fuel reproduce the &quot;Engel's Phenomenon&quot; described above. In the figure below, an &quot;Engel curve, &quot; poverty level is defined as three times the cost of the United States Department of Agriculture's Low Cost Food Plan (USDA-LCFP). Theoretically, at the poverty level, the total income goes to pay the obligate expenses and the cost of necessities â 1/3 for food, 1/3 for housing, and 1/3 for other necessary expenses. Only past poverty incomes does discretionary income appear where discretionary income equals total income minus the cost of obligate expenses and necessities. </text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7496</offset><text>Discretionary (alternatively &quot;disposable&quot;) income refers to funds available after obtaining necessities.

Poorer workers' increased earnings do not generate discretionary income until the total of income from earnings plus supplementation reaches poverty level.

At poverty level or below, all income goes for necessities. Increasing the total income has no effect on discretionary income since none accumulates. Children in families with incomes below the poverty are most 'at risk' for undernutrition â either growth retardation or specific nutrient deficiency. From 1 to 3 times poverty level incomes, discretionary income appears until, at three times the poverty level, all new income is discretionary. As the data provided by Hofferth and Curtin suggest, children who live in families with incomes at the margin of poverty and sufficiency are at increased risk for obesity. These data reinforce similar observations by Garn in his evaluation of data from the Pre School and Ten State Nutrition Surveys of 1968â70. Leanness was found among the poorest and most affluent while adults living in mid-level income families were more likely to be obese.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9322</offset><text>The ratio of change in food expenditures to change in income is called the marginal propensity to spend on food. (5) In developing countries, the marginal propensity to spend on food is high for the poor and low for the affluent. Similarly, in the United States, the last dollar earned by a poor family will represent obligate spending with some part going for food. For the affluent, expenditures for food change little with increased or decreased income. Rather, increased income provides an opportunity for choice as new income is available entirely for discretionary spending. This &quot;income of opportunity&quot; is not available to the poor.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>9962</offset><text>Thus, the appearance of discretionary income will have a profound effect on risk for malnutrition. It is a marker for the opportunity to be &quot;plump and healthy.&quot; Low cost, high-energy foods are readily available and even desirable for families at-risk for food insecurity. Once sufficient income is obtained, concern for the cost of necessities recedes, and neither under nor over nutrition is likely. The opportunity to be &quot;plump and healthy&quot; can be rejected.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>10422</offset><text>A final consideration, deriving from the work of David Barker and colleagues in England is that undernutrition in-utero and during the first months of life is a precursor of obesity and the elements of the metabolic syndrome later in life.

Thus, the nutrient value of the foods purchased by a poor family increases to that of &quot;non-poor&quot; essentially reversing the Engel's phenomenon. Supplemental food programs have shown substantial impact on nutrition in pregnancy and limit weight gain for older children and adults. A study of low-income households, both food secure and insecure, revealed that food assistance programs lower the risk of overweight in low-income children, particularly girls in food insecure households.

The data provided suggests that the appearance of discretionary income is an economic factor closely related to the prevalence of the various forms of under- and overnutrition. No cause and effect relationship is suggested. Rather the appearance of discretionary income, essentially the availability of that last dollar earned for discretionary spending, provides an indicator of the risk for undernutrition, overnutrition, and nutrient imbalance in communities of varying levels of wealth. Working to ensure the availability of food and other necessities as incomes rise to secure levels is one part of the process of preventing the undernutrition of chronic poverty from becoming the obesity of near poverty. Our goal is to move families to the high levels of nutritional status associated with affluence using a combination of income and food support, and community based nutrition education.
