Of particular concern is the lack of progress in maternal and child health (MCH). Results of the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) indicate that progress in the MCH indicators over the past decade has remained slow and that Pakistan's prospects for meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in MCH are bleak. The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in Pakistan is estimated at 276 per 100,000 live births. The MMR is significantly higher in the rural areas and in the less developed province of Balochistan.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2751</offset><text>Maternal mortality remains high in most developing countries though researchers recently have shown a decline from the 1990s. The number of maternal deaths worldwide is believed to range between 300,000 and 400,000 annually, 99.8% of them occurring in the developing countries. It is now recognized that progress toward achieving the fifth MDG in the developing countries is slower than anticipated.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3151</offset><text>It has been argued that lack of involvement of communities in safe motherhood programs is an important reason for persistently high MMR in developing countries. Indeed, a closer look at the 'three delays' model suggests that maternal mortality can be reduced by addressing the delays in decision-making to seek medical care for an obstetric complication and the delays in pre-hospital transportation. The reasons for the first delay (namely: lack of awareness of obstetric danger signs, cultural, social and economic barriers and possibly a lack of trust in the health system) can be addressed through behaviour change communication programs. Similarly, causes of the second delay (lack of access to transport and telecommunication, unfamiliarity with the health system, and financial and social barriers) can be addressed through community mobilization programs. Therefore, both of these delays could be reduced through community-based interventions (CBI) involving women and their husbands, the birth attendants and the community leaders. Regardless of these considerations, country-level evidence accumulated over the last two decades suggests that a reduction in maternal mortality can only be brought about by providing skilled birth attendance and access to emergency obstetric care. What, then, is the role of CBI in this complex problem of multiple dimensions? We address this question in the present paper. We also evaluate the impact of including husbands in the behaviour change communication programs for safe motherhood.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4685</offset><text>Indirect evidence from descriptive studies shows that husbands play an important role in ensuring better pregnancy outcomes and maternal survival. A study in La Paz, Bolivia, found that husbands' knowledge of obstetric danger signs was associated with high utilization of obstetric care services by women. A study in Maharashtra, India, estimated the risk of maternal death (after adjusting for income and place of residence) to be about three times higher among wives of uneducated men compared to women whose husbands had college education.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5228</offset><text>Husbands are often the decision-makers when it comes to seeking medical care for obstetric complications, or to arrange for transportation.

The project was designed to develop and implement a CBI package comprising information and education for empowerment and change (IEEC) for women and their husbands, training of birth attendants in early recognition of obstetric danger signs and providing telecommunication and transportation services for women in need of emergency obstetric and neonatal care (EmONC). IEEC is a strategy for approaching women and their husbands with information about safe motherhood. The CBI package addressed the first two delays. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that the CBI package had a significant impact on maternal and neonatal health (MNH) indicators. A secondary hypothesis is that including husbands in the IEEC strategy significantly increased the impact of CBI on MNH indicators.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>7142</offset><text>Methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7150</offset><text>The project was implemented during 1998-2002 in 32 village clusters in Khuzdar, a rural district of Balochistan province in Pakistan (Figure 1). Balochistan is the most underdeveloped province of Pakistan; approximately 76 percent of the population is in the rural areas. Due to a scattered rural population and absence of proper roads, people's access to health services, particularly hospitals, is extremely limited. In the primitive tribal society, a vast majority of women are uneducated and their mobility is limited. The maternal and child health indicators in Balochistan are the poorest in the country. The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is the highest in Balochistan (786 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, compared to the national average of 276 [Pakistan DHS 2007]).</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">1742-4755-7-30-1.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F1</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>7934</offset><text>Location map of project area</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7963</offset><text>Each village cluster had 5-15 villages and an average population of 2,000.

Each village cluster in zones 2 and 3 was served by a government primary health facility and all villages in the cluster were located within seven kilometres of that health facility. Randomization took place separately within each of the three zones; equal numbers of village clusters were randomly allocated to the intervention or control sites (by blindly drawing village cluster names written on folded chits). Sixteen of the 32 village clusters were thus assigned to the intervention arm while the remaining clusters served as the control arm. In addition, in a randomly selected half (eight) of the intervention clusters, husbands also received IEEC materials that were specially designed for them (Table 1). The impact of interventions on safe motherhood indicators was assessed through pre-intervention (baseline) and post-intervention (follow-up) surveys (Figure 3).</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">1742-4755-7-30-2.jpg</infon><infon key="id">F2</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>9270</offset><text>Distribution of intervention and control clusters</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">T1.xml</infon><infon key="id">T1</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table_caption</infon><offset>9320</offset><text>Description of Interventions</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">T1.xml</infon><infon key="id">T1</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table</infon><infon key="xml">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;

The IEEC materials (pictorial booklets and audiocassettes) were developed after formative research and were field tested for suitability to local culture. The project staff then identified ten female volunteers from each village cluster and trained them as IEEC facilitators. Each facilitator initially invited 10-12 women from close villages to participate in a support group. A typical support group started with a discussion of the problems faced by women during pregnancy and childbirth. Participants were then asked to look at their booklets while listening to a cassette tape that guided them through the pictures in the booklet. The pictures formed part of the dramatized stories recorded on the tape, thus creating an audio-visual effect. The booklet covered the following topics: family planning; nutrition; preparation for pregnancy and delivery; and danger signs during pregnancy, delivery and postpartum. Typically, the booklet was finished in six sessions of 1-2 hours each, after which the participants were entitled to have their personal copy of booklet and audiocassette. Outstanding participants were encouraged to organize and facilitate support groups in their own villages; these women formed the 'second-generation' of IEEC Facilitators - as they were not directly trained by project staff. A 'third generation' of IEEC Facilitators also emerged, thus enabling the project to reach about 4,000 women in three months.

The project also facilitated timely referral and transportation of obstetric and newborn emergencies to the district hospital. Firstly, local owners/operators of public transport vehicles (pickup trucks) were trained in the use of stretchers and were given an orientation to the district hospital, introducing them to the doctors and other medical staff. Secondly, very high frequency (VHF) wireless telecommunication systems were set up in the village clusters located in zones 2 and 3. These systems linked the TBAs and drivers to the local health facility, the hospital and the project office in Khuzdar. Using this system, the TBAs were able to contact the local health facility and the drivers and could ask for an ambulance or other transportation.

It was difficult to control extraneous factors that may have a direct or indirect impact of the indicators of interest. For example, women in the intervention arms sometimes shared their IEEC materials with the women in the control arm. There were also some reports that several of the TBAs trained by the project were called to deliver babies in control villages. Also in the women's only intervention arm, husbands could always look at their wives' booklets, which might have diluted the effect of explicitly adding the husbands' IEEC in the second intervention arm.

First, the women in the women's only IEEC intervention arm reported fewer problems and visited a health facility less frequently than their sisters in the control arm, probably because they were relatively better equipped to identify a serious problem. In the husbands' IEEC arm, on the other hand, more women visited a health facility -- perhaps encouraged by their husbands to see a healthcare provider even for minor problems. Also a significantly greater percent of women in the two intervention arms visited the district hospital for problems related with pregnancy and immediately after delivery. This would have been unlikely without a better understanding of the problem and support from the husband. Second, while the overall percentage of hospital deliveries was low, significantly more women in the intervention arms delivered in the district hospital. The use of prenatal care was also significantly higher in the intervention arms. An added impact of the husbands' IEEC on prenatal care was not observed. Nonetheless, husbands' IEEC resulted in significant improvements in diet and reduced workload of their pregnant wives, more regular use of prophylactic iron and folic acid and more frequent visits to the hospital during pregnancy and delivery.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>29646</offset><text>Historically, studies on maternal mortality have divided the causes of maternal deaths into patient-oriented and hospital-oriented categories. The distinction between deaths among 'booked' and 'un-booked' cases was sometimes used to suggest that pregnant women who did not register for prenatal care were more likely to have complications and die. It was only after the launch of the global safe motherhood initiative that the complex nature of the multiple causes of maternal mortality was recognized. For example, the 'three delays' model identifies the first delay in decision making to seek medical care for obstetric emergencies, which is attributed to lack of awareness. However, another cause of the first delay could be a lack of trust in the health system. Consequently, the strategies to reduce maternal mortality can be classified into community-oriented and health system-oriented categories. This, in part, is an application of the demand and supply theory in maternal health. There is an ongoing debate on which strategies work best to improve the demand and supply of maternal health services. Unfortunately, experimentation with different strategies has been disorganized and lacking an evidence base. Many projects end with only vague conclusions such as maternal mortality is a complex public health problem requiring broad-based improvements in health and social systems. On the other hand, there is little evidence for or against particular sets of interventions to reduce maternal and perinatal mortality at the community or at the health system level.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>31220</offset><text>Bullough et al. reviewed the literature on strategies to reduce maternal mortality and found that current strategies were based upon insufficient evidence. In particular, interventions of community mobilization and training of traditional birth attendants were not based upon sound evidence. They argue that safe motherhood interventions are complex public health approaches and quite different from single clinical interventions. The conclusion is that there is insufficient evidence to recommend universally effective interventions to reduce maternal mortality. While a consistent and sustained improvement in the quality of health services will almost certainly reduce maternal mortality, short-term interventions and vertical programs are less likely to achieve the millennium development goals in maternal health. Unfortunately, the maternal health agenda in many developing countries is driven by donor priorities and perspectives. Donors support vertical programs because their monitoring and evaluation is easier and their results are available quickly. But vertical programs may erode the general standards of health systems by diverting resources from overall quality and focusing on a single problem.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>32432</offset><text>Delays in accessing medical care during emergencies, which are responsible for the bulk of maternal and neonatal deaths, can be addressed in a number of ways.

During 2003-2004, a field trial of the Birth Readiness Package was conducted in the Siraha district of Nepal. This was primarily a program to increase demand, which resulted in a significant increase in the knowledge, and some improvement in maternal practices in the intervention site. However, use of skilled birth attendants and emergency obstetric care remained unchanged, indicating that the problem is not resolved merely by improving the demand for better health services. In fact, while demand is partly associated with supply (i.e. trust in the quality of health services leads to greater demand) it is essential to work on both. The importance of having a two-pronged approach for reducing maternal and neonatal mortality is emphasized by many studies. Darmstadt et al. reviewed the impact of community-based interventions on neonatal mortality in a number of countries. They suggest that in settings with high neonatal mortality, community and family interventions can bring down that mortality effectively, but that a complementary health facility-based care model is also necessary. In Nepal, an educational program in neonatal care for the healthcare providers improved their practices in hospital settings, which led to increased utilization of neonatal services and better chances of survival of the neonates brought to the hospitals.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>34349</offset><text>During 2003-2006, the Population Council conducted an operations research study similar to ours in two rural districts of Punjab province of Pakistan. The primary objective of that study was to disaggregate the impact of CBI from the impact of interventions directed at improving the quality of health services. The study had two intervention arms. In one arm, a CBI package similar to that of our study was implemented along with interventions to improve the quality of emergency obstetric care. In the other arm, interventions were directed to improve the quality of emergency obstetric care but no CBI was implemented. Their results indicate a significant reduction in perinatal mortality, attributed to community-based interventions (IEEC to women and husbands, training of skilled birth attendants and setting up transportation systems). Improvements were also found in other process indicators. The project report concludes that: &quot;This intervention package led to declines in maternal and neonatal mortality ... by increasing the proportion of mothers and neonates with serious emergencies who seek appropriate and timely help, and for neonates by improving home care at and after birth. While there is evidence that perinatal mortality declined in the CBI communities, the changes in knowledge and practice that would be expected to lead to this result are not convincing. There are several possible explanations, for example: The measurements of knowledge and practice were not sufficiently accurate or precise to pick up real and important changes where they occurred&quot; [: p. 42, Report 1]. On the other hand, the study did not find an impact of health services interventions (such as training of doctors) on perinatal and neonatal mortality.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>36100</offset><text>The primary purpose of our study was to test whether CBI to reduce the delays in seeking medical care for obstetric complications could significantly reduce perinatal and neonatal mortality.

Although some of these indicators were better in the husbands' IEEC intervention arm, most of the differences were not statistically significant. This could be explained by the fact that even in the women's only IEEC intervention arm, husbands could look into the IEEC materials provided to their wives.

In spite of the small sample size, there are indications that the husbands' IEEC helped to improve the general health and well-being of women during pregnancy, such as getting prenatal care, taking iron tablets and reducing household workload.
