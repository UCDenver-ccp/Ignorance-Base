Health system and community level interventions for improving antenatal care coverage and health outcomes

Abstract

Background
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends at least four antenatal care (ANC) visits for all pregnant women. Almost half of pregnant women worldwide, and especially in developing countries do not receive this amount of care. Poor attendance of ANC is associated with delivery of low birthweight babies and more neonatal deaths. ANC may include education on nutrition, potential problems with pregnancy or childbirth, child care and prevention or detection of disease during pregnancy.
This review focused on community-based interventions and health systems-related interventions.

Objectives
To assess the effects of health system and community interventions for improving coverage of antenatal care and other perinatal health outcomes.

Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (7 June 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies.

Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised trials and cluster-randomised trials. Trials of any interventions to improve ANC coverage were eligible for inclusion. Trials were also eligible if they targeted specific and related outcomes, such as maternal or perinatal death, but also reported ANC coverage.

Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy.

Main results
We included 34 trials involving approximately 400,000 women. Some trials tested community-based interventions to improve uptake of antenatal care (media campaigns, education or financial incentives for pregnant women), while other trials looked at health systems interventions (home visits for pregnant women or equipment for clinics). Most trials took place in low- and middle-income countries, and 29 of the 34 trials used a cluster-randomised design. We assessed 30 of the 34 trials as of low or unclear overall risk of bias.
Comparison 1: One intervention versus no intervention
We found marginal improvements in ANC coverage of at least four visits (average odds ratio (OR) 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 1.22; participants = 45,022; studies = 10; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.01; I² = 52%; high quality evidence ). Sensitivity analysis with a more conservative intra-cluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) gave similar marginal results. Excluding one study at high risk of bias shifted the marginal pooled estimate towards no effect. There was no effect on pregnancy-related deaths (average OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.08; participants = 114,930; studies = 10; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.00; I² = 0%; low quality evidence ), perinatal mortality (average OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.07; studies = 15; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.01; I² = 58%; moderate quality evidence ) or low birthweight (average OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.06; studies = five; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.00; I² = 5%; high quality evidence ). Single interventions led to marginal improvements in the number of women who delivered in health facilities (average OR 1.08, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.15; studies = 10; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.00; I² = 0%; high quality evidence ), and in the proportion of women who had at least one ANC visit (average OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.79; studies = six; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.24; I² = 76%; moderate quality evidence ). Results for ANC coverage (at least four and at least one visit) and for perinatal mortality had substantial statistical heterogeneity. Single interventions did not improve the proportion of women receiving tetanus protection (average OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.15; studies = 8; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.01; I² = 57%). No study reported on intermittent prophylactic treatment for malaria.
Comparison 2: Two or more interventions versus no intervention
We found no improvements in ANC coverage of four or more visits (average OR 1.48, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.21; participants = 7840; studies = six; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.10; I² = 48%; low quality evidence ) or pregnancy-related deaths (average OR 0.70, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.26; participants = 13,756; studies = three; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.00; I² = 0%; moderate quality evidence ). However, combined interventions led to improvements in ANC coverage of at least one visit (average OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.17; studies = five; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.00; I² = 0%; moderate quality evidence ), perinatal mortality (average OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.95; studies = five; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.06; I² = 83%; moderate quality evidence ) and low birthweight (average OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.80; studies = two; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.00; I² = 0%; moderate quality evidence ). Meta-analyses for both ANC coverage four or more visits and perinatal mortality had substantial statistical heterogeneity. Combined interventions improved the proportion of women who had tetanus protection (average OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.87; studies = 3; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.01; I² = 33%). No trial in this comparison reported on intermittent prophylactic treatment for malaria .
Comparison 3: Two interventions compared head to head. No trials found.
Comparison 4: One intervention versus a combination of interventions
There was no difference in ANC coverage (four or more visits and at least one visit) , pregnancy-related deaths , deliveries in a health facility or perinatal mortality . No trials in this comparison reported on low birthweight or intermittent prophylactic treatment of malaria .

Authors' conclusions
Implications for practice - Single interventions may improve ANC coverage (at least one visit and four or more visits) and deliveries in health facilities. Combined interventions may improve ANC coverage (at least one visit), reduce perinatal mortality and reduce the occurrence of low birthweight. The effects of the interventions are unrelated to whether they are community or health system interventions.
Implications for research - More details should be provided in reporting numbers of events, group totals and the ICCs used to adjust for cluster effects. Outcomes should be reported uniformly so that they are comparable to commonly-used population indicators. We recommend further cluster-RCTs of pregnant women and women in their reproductive years, using combinations of interventions and looking at outcomes that are important to pregnant women, such as maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, alongside the explanatory outcomes along the pathway of care: ANC coverage, the services provided during ANC and deliveries in health facilities.

PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY

Health system and community level interventions for improving antenatal care coverage and health outcomes
What is the issue?
The World Health Organization recommends at least four antenatal visits for all pregnant women. Almost half of pregnant women worldwide miss out on this level of care, and this is more problematic in low- and middle-income countries.
Why is this important?
Healthcare during pregnancy is a priority because poor antenatal attendance is associated with delivery of low birthweight babies and more newborn deaths. Antenatal care also provides opportunity for nutritional and health checks, such as whether a woman has a disease like malaria or has been exposed to infectious diseases such as HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) or syphilis.
What evidence did we find?
We reviewed randomised controlled trials that tested ways to improve the uptake of antenatal care during pregnancy. Some trials tested community-based interventions (media campaigns, education on self and infant care or financial incentives for pregnant women to attend antenatal care), while other trials looked at health systems interventions (home visits for pregnant women or provision of equipment for clinics). We included 34 trials with approximately 400,000 women. Most trials took place in low- and middle-income countries, and most trials were conducted in a way that made us feel confident about trusting the published reports. We assessed 30 of the 34 trials as of low or unclear overall risk of bias. The quality rating ( high , moderate or low ) shows our level of confidence that the result is robust and meaningful.
Trials comparing one intervention with no intervention
Single interventions only marginally improved the numbers of women attending four antenatal visits (high quality). Interventions did not improve rates of maternal death ( low quality ), baby deaths ( moderate quality ) or low birthweight ( high quality ). Even so, interventions led to modest improvements in the number of women who had at least one antenatal visit ( moderate quality ) and who delivered in a health facility ( high quality ). The number of women who received intermittent preventive treatment for malaria was not reported.
Trials comparing two or more interventions with no intervention
Combined interventions did not improve the number of women with four or more visits ( low quality ), or reduce maternal deaths ( moderate quality ). Nor did it increase the number of women who delivered in a health facility ( moderate quality ). However, more women who received combined interventions had one or more antenatal visits ( moderate quality ); there were also fewer baby deaths ( moderate quality ) and fewer low birthweight babies ( moderate quality ). The number of women who received intermittent preventive treatment for malaria was not reported.
We found no evidence that trials of community interventions worked differently from trials of health systems interventions.
Trials comparing one intervention with another intervention - there were no trials for this comparison.
Trials comparing one intervention with a combination of interventions - There was no difference in the number of women attending four or more antenatal visits (and at least one visit), maternal deaths, baby deaths, the number of deliveries in a health facility or the number of women who received intermittent preventive treatment for malaria.
What does this mean?
Single interventions may improve antenatal care coverage (women attending at least one visit and women attending four or more visits) and encourage women to give birth to their babies in health facilities. Combined interventions may also improve antenatal care coverage (at least one visit), reduce baby deaths and reduce the number of babies born with low birthweight.
We recommend that further studies of pregnant women and women in their reproductive years use combinations of interventions to maximise impact and look at outcomes that are important to the women themselves, such as maternal and baby deaths or ill health and the use of healthcare services.

CI: Confidence interval; RR: Risk ratio; OR: Odds ratio.Denominators for the calculation of the absolute comparative effects have been taken from individual trial reports or from Prost2013. Where different denominators are stated in different reports, we have taken the larger. The median control group risk has been calculated from event and participant raw data, where this was available. If we found no raw event and participant data in published reports, these trials were not included in the calculation of the median control group risk.Both the participant totals and the median control group risk are for illustrative purposes only. In the majority of the trials in this review, the final odds ratio presented will not correspond with raw event and participant data due to adjustments made for the effects of cluster design.We have designated the control risk as moderate because it is based on the median of a wide range of baseline rates in control groups.

Background
In 2010, about 287,000 maternal deaths occurred worldwide (WHO2013a). Despite considerable efforts to curb maternal mortality, close to 800 women continue to die every day due to complications of pregnancy and childbirth, and about 99% of these deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (WHO2012c). In these settings, neonatal mortality rates are also high, despite the availability of evidence-based interventions that could avert up to 72% of neonatal deaths (Darmstadt2005). Interventions such as maternal immunisation against tetanus and skilled care at delivery can reduce both maternal and neonatal deaths (Lassi2015).
Interventions to reduce maternal mortality may focus on three periods. The first is during pregnancy (antenatal care; ANC), the second is the intrapartum period, (i.e. during labour and delivery) and the third is in the postpartum period (after delivery). The intrapartum period is much shorter and less predictable than the longer more stable pregnancy period (Mbuagbaw2011). It is also more challenging to provide adequate care in this period, especially in low- and middle-income countries where human resource shortages and other health system weaknesses limit the availability of emergency obstetric care (Dogba2009). ANC, on the other hand, is less resource-intensive and its provision can be spread throughout the pregnancy period.
ANC generally comprises the following interventions (Kinzie2004).

Health promotion: ANC is an opportunity to educate the woman about her health, pregnancy and childbirth, recognising danger signs, the benefits of good nutrition and exclusive breastfeeding, the harms of alcohol, tobacco and drugs, and other relevant issues.
Disease prevention: immunisation against tetanus, prophylactic treatment against malaria, and protection against iron-deficiency anaemia are some conditions that can de addressed during ANC visits.
Early detection and treatment for complications and diseases: pregnant women can be screened for syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other sexually transmitted infections. Complications of pregnancy such as pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, infection and vaginal bleeding among others can be addressed.
Birth preparedness: the pregnant woman is counselled on her decision about where to deliver, choice of a skilled birth attendant and a caregiver (for herself or her other children at home). The ANC visit may cover planning for transportation to the hospital, costs of care and supplies for delivery.
Complication readiness: women are encouraged to have an emergency plan for complicated deliveries. This plan should include money for extra medical or surgical care and potential blood donors.
ANC may not address all the causes of maternal deaths; however, it is positively associated with receiving professional assistance at delivery (Bloom1999; Mbuagbaw2011; Mishra2006; Oakley2009) and improved pregnancy outcomes such as normal birthweight (Mbuagbaw2011). In different regions, the effects of ANC on enhancing rates of delivery in a health facility are disparate (Mbuagbaw2011; Raatikainen2007).

Description of the condition
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends at least four ANC visits for all pregnant women (WHO2013).The first visit should take place during the first trimester (before the 12th week but no later than the 16th week), the second visit between the 24th and 28th week, and the third and fourth visits at 32 weeks and 36 weeks, respectively. Reports indicate that only 53% of pregnant women worldwide receive this amount of care (WHO2013). Coverage is lower in low- and middle-income countries where the use of maternal health care in general is limited and varies widely within and between countries (Say2007). Poor attendance of ANC is associated with delivery of low birthweight infants (Mbuagbaw2011; Raatikainen2007; Showstack1984; Siza2008), and more neonatal deaths (Raatikainen2007). ANC models with reduced visits may also be linked to higher perinatal mortality (Dowswell2015; Vogel2013).

Measuring antenatal care
Even though the WHO recommends four ANC visits during pregnancy, this is not a very informative measure (WHO2013), as it gives no indication of the quality or timing of the visits. Furthermore, there is no measure of access. A comprehensive measure of ANC should include a measure of personal health-seeking behaviour and also a measure of the availability of ANC services, as both are integral to effective ANC. More comprehensive measures have been proposed, which include the number and timing of visits, the provider of care and the adequacy of care provided (Delgado-Rodriguez 1996; Mbuagbaw2011). Well-timed ANC visits are critical to the success of some interventions, as a systematic review has shown that adverse outcomes from syphilis can best be prevented by intervening in the first two trimesters (Hawkes2013). The content of each ANC visit is also important, as some ANC interventions may not be beneficial, such as high does concomitant supplementation with vitamin C and vitamin E to prevent pre-eclampsia in high-risk women (Poston2006). Irrespective of how it is measured, ANC is beneficial and represents an important point of contact with the health system for communication and pregnancy preparedness (Lassi2015).
For the purposes of this review, coverage will be considered as the proportion of pregnant women who attend at least four ANC visits.

Description of the intervention
The fifth United Nations' Millenium Development Goal (MDG5) targets maternal health and explicitly calls for more ANC (UnitedNations 2013). The WHO now recommends a package of reduced visits with evidence-based interventions through goal-oriented clinic visits (WHO2011). A variety of interventions can be used to increase the number of women who receive ANC. A systematic review on the effectiveness of interventions to improve early initiation of ANC in vulnerable populations identified two broad categories of interventions: outreach/community-based interventions and alternative models of clinic-based ANC. The former included the use of lay health workers and mobile health clinics, while the latter included adaptations of clinic-based ANC to be more collaborative and comprehensive, and also to accommodate teens (Oakley2009).
Community-based interventions such as community support, mobilisation, education and home visits by trained community health workers can lead to significant reductions in maternal morbidity and neonatal mortality, and an increase in referrals to a health facility (Lassi2015). In underserved areas, a community health van may improve access to adequate ANC (Edgerley2007).
Other interventions, such as mass media campaigns, social mobilisation, information-education-communication (IEC) interventions, financial incentives, behaviour change interventions and policy interventions targeting health workers or pregnant women will also be investigated.

How the intervention might work
Interventions targeting the factors that reduce antenatal care coverage may be beneficial.
Health policy is a critical component of any health system and guides how resources (man power, money and material) are used. Policy can be applied at any level of the health system. Regional health managers are capable of making policy changes that influence the use of ANC services. Recent papers suggest that the effects of policy change in health outcomes should be explored in more detail (Dettrick2013). Such policy changes may include capacity building in ANC to improve quality of care (Lassi2015; Say2007; vanEijk 2006), re-organisation of services to include more midwives providing ANC (Dowswell2015;Khan-Neelofur 1998), and reduction of user fees to eliminate financial barriers (Lassi2015; Mbuagbaw2011; Say2007; Titaley2010; vanEijk 2006). Where coverage is better in the private sector (Cesar2012), adopting their (private sector) model of care may be beneficial. Switching to individual counselling sessions may also improve the number of high-risk women delivering in hospitals (Ballard2013).
Mass media campaigns can be used to improve the utilisation of health services (Grilli2002), and may also help to improve the use of ANC services. Social mobilisation - engaging multiple stakeholders - is an important way of bringing change in communities. If pregnant women receive the same consistent message on the benefits of ANC from health workers, community health workers and in other social gatherings, they may be more likely to take heed. Lack of awareness (Lassi2015; Titaley2010) and misconceptions (Agus2012; Say2007) about ANC can be addressed using IEC sessions. Financial incentives can be used to encourage pregnant women to attend ANC and cover costs including user fees and transportation costs where these problems exist (Lassi2015; Mbuagbaw2011; Say2007; Titaley2010; vanEijk 2006). They are most effective in the short term, and in resource-limited settings (Marteau2009). Behaviour change interventions are interventions derived from a specific model or theory of behaviour change and can play a role in improving health outcomes (Marteau2006). Such interventions could play an important role in encouraging women to attend ANC.

Why it is important to do this review
Regions of the world with low ANC coverage can benefit from a comprehensive synthesis of the evidence surrounding the ways in which ANC coverage can be improved. In these places, low ANC coverage comes with low rates of deliveries in health facilities and assistance by skilled birth attendants. The latter two factors are associated with high materno-fetal morbidity. This review will have important implications for reproductive health policy, the provision of services to women in reproductive ages and may highlight gaps in current evidence or openings for further research.

Objectives
To assess the effects of health system and community interventions for improving coverage of antenatal care and other outcomes.

Methods

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised trials and cluster-randomised trials. Trials of cross-over design were not eligible. Trials reported in abstract form were eligible for inclusion in the review; however, we did not include any trial based on an abstract report alone.

Types of participants
This review included studies of stakeholders, providers of care and beneficiaries, including but not limited to:

professional health workers;
lay health workers;
community members;
pregnant women;
women of reproductive age.

Types of interventions
All interventions susceptible to improve coverage of ANC were eligible for inclusion in this review. These interventions could be aimed at the health system, the population or both. Owing to the potentially wide variety of interventions, there were no restrictions to duration or frequency of the intervention. For the purposes of this review, we classified these interventions into the following two main categories.

Interventions aimed at the health system

Policy changes.
Health worker education.
Re-organisation of health services.

Interventions aimed at the community

Mass media campaigns.
Social mobilisation.
Information-education-communication (IEC).
Financial incentives.
Behaviour change interventions.

Types of outcome measures

Primary outcomes

Coverage of ANC: the proportion of pregnant women who attend at least four ANC visits during pregnancy.
Pregnancy-related deaths: the proportion of women who die during pregnancy or 42 days after, irrespective of cause (WHO2004).

Secondary outcomes

Coverage of ANC: the proportion of pregnant women who attend at least one ANC visit during pregnancy.
The proportion of pregnant women who initiate ANC in the first trimester.
The proportion of pregnant women who receive ANC from professional health workers.
The proportion of deliveries in health facilities.
The proportion of pregnant women with a written birth and emergency plan by 37 weeks of pregnancy.
The proportion of pregnant women who receive Intermittent Prophylactic Treatment (IPT) for malaria as per recommended guidelines (WHO2012b).
The proportion of women with tetanus protection at birth.
The proportion of pregnant women who screen for syphilis.
The proportion of women who screen for asymptomatic bacteriuria.
The proportion of women who screen for HIV.
The proportion of women with HIV who receive a complete antiretroviral course for prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.
Maternal near miss, defined as: "a woman who nearly died but survived a complication that occurred during pregnancy, childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy" (Pattinson2009).
The proportion of women with preterm labour or delivery.
The proportion of low-birthweight infants born.
The incidence of perinatal mortality.
We also considered combinations of the above outcomes if the data were not dissociable. For example, the proportion of women who have at least four well-spaced ANC visits attended by a professional health worker (Mbuagbaw2011).

Search methods for identification of studies
The following methods section of this review is based on a standard template used by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group.

Electronic searches
We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register by contacting the Trials Search Co-ordinator (7 June 2015).
The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group’s Trials Register is maintained by the Trials Search Co-ordinator and contains trials identified from:

monthly searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL);
weekly searches of MEDLINE (Ovid);
weekly searches of Embase (Ovid);
monthly searches of CINAHL (EBSCO);
handsearches of 30 journals and the proceedings of major conferences;
weekly current awareness alerts for a further 44 journals plus monthly BioMed Central email alerts.
Details of the search strategies for CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL, the list of handsearched journals and conference proceedings, and the list of journals reviewed via the current awareness service can be found in the ‘Specialized Register’ section within the editorial information about the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group.
Trials identified through the searching activities described above are each assigned to a review topic (or topics). The Trials Search Co-ordinator searches the register for each review using the topic list rather than keywords.

Searching other resources
We searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and contacted authors and experts in the field. We did not apply any language or date restrictions.

Data collection and analysis
The following methods section of this review is based on a standard template used by the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group.

Selection of studies
Two review authors (L Mbuagbaw (LM) and N Medley (NM)) independently assessed all the potential studies we identified for inclusion. We resolved any disagreement through discussion or, if required, by consulting a third author (P Ongolo-Zogo (POZ)). Agreement on the inclusion of studies was estimated using the Kappa statistic (Viera2005).
A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) study flow diagram was created to map out the number of records identified, included and excluded (Liberati2009).

Data extraction and management
We designed and tested a form to extract data. For eligible studies (abstract or full text), LM, AD and NM extracted the data using the agreed form. We resolved discrepancies through discussion or, if required, we consulted a third review author (POZ). We entered data into Review Manager software (RevMan2014) and checked for accuracy.
When information regarding any of the above was unclear, we attempted to contact authors of the original reports to provide further details.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Review authors LM and NM independently assessed risk of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins2011). We resolved any disagreement by discussion or by involving a third assessor (POZ).

(1) Random sequence generation (checking for possible selection bias)
We described for each included study the method used to generate the allocation sequence in sufficient detail to allow an assessment of whether it should produce comparable groups.
We assessed the method as:

low risk of bias (any truly random process, e.g. random number table; computer random number generator);
high risk of bias (any non-random process, e.g. odd or even date of birth; hospital or clinic record number);
unclear risk of bias.

(2) Allocation concealment (checking for possible selection bias)
We described for each included study the method used to conceal allocation to interventions prior to assignment and assessed whether intervention allocation could have been foreseen in advance of, or during recruitment, or changed after assignment.
We assessed the methods as:

low risk of bias (e.g. telephone or central randomisation; consecutively numbered sealed opaque envelopes);
high risk of bias (open random allocation; unsealed or non-opaque envelopes, alternation; date of birth);
unclear risk of bias (cluster-RCTs that reported no allocation concealment and RCTs that made no mention of allocation concealment).

(3.1) Blinding of participants and personnel (checking for possible performance bias)
We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind study participants and personnel from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We considered that studies were at low risk of bias if they were blinded, or if we judged that the lack of blinding would be unlikely to affect results. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.
We assessed the methods as:

low, high or unclear risk of bias for participants;
low, high or unclear risk of bias for personnel.

(3.2) Blinding of outcome assessment (checking for possible detection bias)
We described for each included study the methods used, if any, to blind outcome assessors from knowledge of which intervention a participant received. We assessed blinding separately for different outcomes or classes of outcomes.
We assessed methods used to blind outcome assessment as:

low, high or unclear risk of bias. We entered "unclear risk" for studies that were not blinded for participants/personnel, or where blinding was not described, as most often blinding was not possible due to the nature of the intervention. It is unclear whether a lack of blinding presented a serious risk of bias in cluster-RCTs with mortality outcomes.

(4) Incomplete outcome data (checking for possible attrition bias due to the amount, nature and handling of incomplete outcome data)
We described for each included study, and for each outcome or class of outcomes, the completeness of data including attrition and exclusions from the analysis. We stated whether attrition and exclusions were reported and the numbers included in the analysis at each stage (compared with the total randomised participants), reasons for attrition or exclusion where reported, and whether missing data were balanced across groups or were related to outcomes. Where sufficient information was reported, or was supplied by the trial authors, we re-included missing data in the analyses which we undertook.
We assessed methods as:

low risk of bias (e.g. no missing outcome data; missing outcome data balanced across groups);
high risk of bias (e.g. numbers or reasons for missing data imbalanced across groups; ‘as treated’ analysis done with substantial departure of intervention received from that assigned at randomisation);
unclear risk of bias.
Attrition of 20% or more was considered as high risk of bias.

(5) Selective reporting (checking for reporting bias)
We described for each included study how we investigated the possibility of selective outcome reporting bias and what we found.
We assessed the methods as:

low risk of bias (where it is clear that all of the study’s pre-specified outcomes and all expected outcomes of interest to the review have been reported);
high risk of bias (where not all the study’s pre-specified outcomes have been reported; one or more reported primary outcomes were not pre-specified; outcomes of interest are reported incompletely and so cannot be used; study fails to include results of a key outcome that would have been expected to have been reported);
unclear risk of bias.

(6) Other bias (checking for bias due to problems not covered by (1) to (5) above)
We described for each included study any important concerns we had about other possible sources of bias.
We assessed whether each study was free of other problems that could put it at risk of bias:

low risk of other bias;
high risk of other bias;
unclear whether there is risk of other bias.

(7) Overall risk of bias
We made explicit judgements about whether studies were at high risk of bias, according to the criteria given in the Handbook (Higgins2011). With reference to (1) to (6) above, we assessed the likely magnitude and direction of the bias and whether we considered it was likely to impact on the findings. We explored the impact of the level of bias by undertaking sensitivity analyses - see Sensitivity analysis.
For the cluster-randomised trials we included, additional sources bias were considered (Higgins2011), such as:

recruitment bias: whether individuals were recruited into the trial after the clusters had been formed;
baseline imbalances: due to the small numbers of clusters;
attrition of entire clusters;
analysis bias: methods of analysis ignoring the correlation between members of the same cluster;
their comparability with individually-randomised trials.

Assessing the quality of the body of evidence using the GRADE approach
The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach as outlined in the GRADE Handbook in order to assess the quality of the body of evidence relating to the following outcomes.

Coverage of ANC: the proportion of pregnant women who attend at least four ANC visits during pregnancy.
Pregnancy-related deaths: the proportion of women who die during pregnancy or 42 days after, irrespective of cause (WHO2004).
Coverage of ANC: the proportion of pregnant women who attend at least one ANC visit during pregnancy.
The proportion of deliveries in health facilities.
The incidence of perinatal mortality.
The proportion of low-birthweight infants born.
The proportion of pregnant women who receive Intermittent Prophylactic Treatment (IPT) for malaria as per recommended guidelines (WHO2012b).
The comparisons used to assess the quality of evidence were: Comparison 1: one intervention versus no intervention, and Comparison 2: multiple interventions versus no intervention.
We used the GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool to import data from Review Manager 5.3 (RevMan2014) in order to create 'Summary of findings' tables. A summary of the intervention effect and a measure of quality for each of the above outcomes was produced using the GRADE approach. The GRADE approach uses five considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome. The evidence can be downgraded from 'high quality' by one level for serious (or by two levels for very serious) limitations, depending on assessments for risk of bias, indirectness of evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or potential publication bias.
We downgraded outcomes for substantial heterogeneity where the I2= 60%. Because lack of blinding of participants and personnel was nearly universal and would have been prohibitive to the implementation of our included trials, we did not downgrade evidence for lack of blinding during our GRADE assessments. Where we downgraded outcome evidence for risk of bias concerns, these design limitations had to do with the trials' problems with other bias domains, not lack of blinding.

Measures of treatment effect

Dichotomous data
For dichotomous data, we planned to present results as summary risk ratio with 95% confidence intervals. However, the trials in our review reported several different summary effect measures, and the majority presented cluster-adjusted odds ratios. To make use of these trial data and retain the specific adjustments made by trial statisticians, we have presented our results as odds ratios, with 95% confidence intervals.

Continuous data
For continuous data, we planned to use the mean difference if outcomes were measured in the same way between trials. We would have used the standardised mean difference to combine trials that measured the same outcome, but used different methods.

Unit of analysis issues

Cluster-randomised trials
We included cluster-randomised trials in the analyses along with individually-randomised trials. The review statistician (M Richardson) made appropriate adjustments according to the type of data available from trial reports and through correspondence with authors. Where possible, we adjusted a trials' sample sizes using the methods described in the Handbook using an estimate of the intracluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) derived from the trial, from a similar trial or from a study of a similar population. We consulted Piaggio2001, Pagel2011, Prost2013, Kidney2009and Souza2013. Professor Souza further provided an ICC for maternal mortality via email. We conducted sensitivity analyses using two extreme values of ICC to investigate the effect of variation in the ICC for the primary outcome only. We have provided details of the specific ICCs used and of any additional methods required to analyse trial data in the additional tables. There is one table of adjustments made for each outcome relevant to the 'Summary of findings' table. Similar details of adjustments made for the analyses of other review outcomes are freely available upon request from the review team.
For cluster- and individually-randomised trials, we considered it reasonable to combine the results from both, if there was little heterogeneity between the study designs and the interaction between the effect of intervention and the choice of randomisation unit was considered to be unlikely. We acknowledged heterogeneity in the randomisation unit, but we have not conducted sensitivity analysis by randomisation unit because all but five of the included trials are cluster-randomised. Per outcome, there are not sufficient individually-randomised trials for a subgroup (often just one or no individually-randomised trial contributed). If in future updates we include several more individually-randomised trials, we will perform sensitivity analysis, though at present all of the trials in ongoing studies are of cluster-randomised design.

Other unit of analysis issues
No included trial specifically recruited multiple pregnancies. However, several if not most of the review's trials likely included women with multiple pregnancies. Where this information was provided in trial reports, we have noted this in the Characteristics of included studies table. Results were not reported separately for twins in any included trial. The proportion of twin pregnancies per trial was assumed to be low, and we have not made any adjustments to outcome data for their inclusion.
Some of the included studies had more than one intervention arm. Where appropriate, two intervention arms were combined, and pair-wise comparisons conducted. Where necessary, we have also split trials. For example, we divided trials if trials had multiple arms and interventions and those interventions were relevant to separate review comparisons. Finally, we have split the control group when necessary to avoid double counting. Please see the included studies tables for Lewycka2013aand Morris2004afor specific details.
For quasi-randomised studies, we planned to use estimates adjusted for baseline imbalances and other confounders.

Dealing with missing data
For included studies, we noted levels of attrition and explored the impact of including studies with high levels of missing data in the overall assessment of treatment effect by using sensitivity analysis.
For all outcomes, we carried out analyses, as far as possible, on an intention-to-treat basis, i.e. we attempted to include all participants randomised to each group in the analyses, and all participants were analysed in the group to which they were allocated, regardless of whether or not they received the allocated intervention. The denominator for each outcome in each trial was the number randomised minus any participants whose outcomes were known to be missing.

Assessment of heterogeneity
We assessed statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis using the I², T² and Chi² statistics. We regarded heterogeneity as substantial if an I² was greater than 30% and either a T² was greater than zero, or there was a low P value (less than 0.10) in the Chi² test for heterogeneity. We have left the overall totals turned off only if the effect estimates of different trials were so disparate that it made little clinical sense to combine the trials (for example, if effect estimates fell on opposite sides of the line of no difference and the trials' confidence intervals do not overlap). Overall, even with high heterogeneity in several outcomes, the effect estimates were reasonably similar, and confidence intervals always overlapped. We have not turned off the totals for any outcome listed below.

Assessment of reporting biases
We investigated reporting biases (such as publication bias) using funnel plots. We assessed funnel plot asymmetry visually. If asymmetry was suggested by a visual assessment, we performed exploratory analyses to investigate it.

Data synthesis
We carried out statistical analysis using the Review Manager software (RevMan2014). We planned to use fixed-effect meta-analysis for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect: i.e. where trials were examining the same intervention, and the trials’ populations and methods were judged sufficiently similar. In practice, we found considerable clinical heterogeneity between the included studies in the review and expected high statistical heterogeneity as a consequence. Therefore, we used random-effects models to conduct all meta-analyses. Where high heterogeneity in the overall summary was found, we left analyses pooled and advised readers to interpret the results with caution.
The random-effects summary was treated as the average range of possible treatment effects and was reported as such, with 95% confidence intervals, and the estimates of T² and I².
We considered the following comparisons.

One intervention versus no intervention.
Two interventions compared.
One intervention versus a combination of interventions.
Combination of interventions versus no intervention.
Different combinations of interventions.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We planned to carry out the following subgroup analyses.

Urban versus rural settings.
High-income versus lower-income settings.
Interventions targeting the health system versus interventions targeting the population.
These subgroup analyses were limited to the primary outcomes of the review.
We were not able to conduct analyses for urban versus rural settings because our trials were overwhelmingly rural. For example, 14 of 19 trials contributing data for the primary outcome of ANC coverage (at least four visits) took place in rural settings, with just three in urban settings (one trial had mixed settings and one trial report was unclear).
We conducted subgroup analyses comparing trials in upper-middle and high-income countries with trials set in low- and lower-middle-income countries for the outcome of ANC coverage (at least four visits) only (WorldBank 2015); there were insufficient data for this analysis for the primary outcome of maternal mortality, because just three of 10 trials contributing data were conducted in higher-income settings.
We conducted subgroup analysis with trials targeting the health system versus trials targeting the population. All subgroup analyses will be re-assessed when more trials are added during future updates of the review.
We assessed subgroup differences by interaction tests available within RevMan (RevMan2014). We reported the results of subgroup analyses quoting the χ2 statistic and P value, and the interaction test I² value.

Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to explore the effects of trial quality and trial design on the outcomes. In the first instance, we compared the results from the studies with high risk of bias with those at low risk of bias, and secondly we investigated the effect of the unit of randomisation (individual versus cluster) on the outcomes. Likewise, we also explored the effects of fixed-effect or random-effects analyses for outcomes with statistical heterogeneity and the effects of any assumptions made such as the value of the ICC used for cluster-randomised trials.

Results

Description of studies

Results of the search
The search of the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register retrieved 148 reports; we found three further reports during our own searches (see: Figure1). We included 34 trials (79 reports) and excluded 30 trials (59 reports). Thirteen studies (13 reports) are ongoing (see Characteristics of ongoing studies), and we await trial completion or the publication of results. We have been unable to locate published data for any of the trials in ‘ongoing studies,’ as of 1 Sept, 2015. Two trials with multiple arms were divided for analyses (Lewycka 2014; Morris 2004), brining the total number of tables for included studies and risk of bias to 36.

Included studies
A total of 34 trials were identified as eligible for inclusion in this review. Trials involved approximately 400,000 women who were either of reproductive age or pregnant. Ten of the included trials aimed to evaluate health system interventions only (Basinga2011; Darmstadt2010; Kenyon2012; Lund2012; Majoko2007; Penfold2014; Persson2013; Richter2014; Villar2001 (WHO 2001); Walker2013). One trial with multiple arms aimed to evaluate health system and community interventions separately and together (Morris2004a). Ten trials evaluated community interventions alone (Barber2008; Fottrell2013; Laken1995; Lewycka2013a; Manandhar2004; Melnikow1997; More2012; Mori2015; Mullany2007; Tripathy2010). The rest of the trials (13) aimed to evaluate a combination of health system and community interventions (Azad2010; Baqui2008; Bhutta2011; Kirkwood2013; Klerman2001; Kumar2008; leRoux 2013; Midhet2010; Omer2008; Villar1992; Wahlstrom2011; Waiswa2015; Wu2011).
Included trials took place in: Argentina (2), Bangladesh (4), Brazil, Cuba (2), Eastern China, Ghana, Honduras, India (3), Laos, Malawi, Mexico (3), Mongolia, Nepal (2), Pakistan (3), Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, South Africa (2), Southern Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda, United Kingdom, USA (3), Vietnam, Zanzibar and Zimbabwe. Two trials, Villar1992and Villar2001 (WHO 2001), recruited clusters in multiple countries. Five trials were conducted in upper-middle- or high-income countries (Kenyon2012; Klerman2001; Laken1995; Melnikow1997; Villar1992); the remaining trials took place in low- or lower-middle-income countries. Trials were overwhelmingly rural (22/34), with seven trials in mixed settings and four trials in urban settings; the setting of a final trial was unclear.
All trials were of cluster-randomised design, apart from five (Kenyon2012; Klerman2001; Laken1995; Melnikow1997; Mullany2007). Sample sizes ranged from a few hundred to more than 50,000, while cluster numbers ranged from eight to 506. Follow-up times ranged from six to 72 months.

Interventions
Ten trials evaluated health system interventions (Basinga2011; Darmstadt2010; Kenyon2012; Lund2012; Majoko2007; Penfold2014; Persson2013; Richter2014; Villar2001 (WHO 2001); Walker2013). Three of the nine trials included interventions aimed at policy change (Basinga2011; Lund2012; Persson2013). One trial provided financial support to the clusters (Basinga2011); one trial sent text reminders and mobile credit vouchers (Lund2012) , and one trial held regular stakeholder problem-solving meetings with generated actions (Persson2013). Seven trials aimed for reorganisation of the health services (Darmstadt2010; Kenyon2012; Majoko2007; Penfold2014; Richter2014; Villar2001 (WHO 2001); Walker2013). Four trials added home visits (Darmstadt2010; Kenyon2012; Penfold2014; Richter2014); two trials restructured the visits (Majoko2007; Villar2001 (WHO 2001)), and one trial added an obstetric nurse to rural clinics (Walker2013).
In a four-armed trial Morris2004atested a policy change, financial support and a combination of the two interventions against no intervention.
Ten trials evaluated community interventions (Barber2008; Fottrell2013; Laken1995; Lewycka2013a; Manandhar2004; Melnikow1997; More2012; Mori2015; Mullany2007; Tripathy2010). The majority of trials (7/10) were based on Information-education-communication (IEC) interventions (Fottrell2013; Lewycka2013a; Manandhar2004; More2012; Mori2015; Mullany2007; Tripathy2010). Of the seven trials, five held participatory women’s groups (Fottrell2013; Lewycka2013a; Manandhar2004; More2012; Tripathy2010); one trial had private education sessions (Mullany2007), and one trial provided women with their own case notes to carry to antenatal visits (Mori2015). The other four trials gave financial incentives (Barber2008; Laken1995; Melnikow1997; Morris2004a).
Thirteen trials were based on combined health system and community interventions (Azad2010; Baqui2008; Bhutta2011; Kirkwood2013; Klerman2001; Kumar2008; leRoux 2013; Midhet2010; Omer2008; Villar1992; Wahlstrom2011; Waiswa2015; Wu2011). Several trials provided IEC as a community intervention. These included: participatory women’s groups (Azad2010), community awareness meetings (Baqui2008; Bhutta2011; Klerman2001; Kumar2008; Wahlstrom2011); the provision of information booklets and cassettes and mass media campaigns (Midhet2010; Villar1992; Wu2011); and home education sessions (Kirkwood2013; leRoux 2013; Omer2008). Azad2010, Bhutta2011, Kirkwood2013, Midhet2010, Waiswa2015, and Wu2011provided healthcare worker training as a health system package to the intervention group. Baqui2008offered surveillance and home visits (two ANC, three perinatal mortality rate (PNC)) by community health workers (CHWs) and the provision of iron and folic acid supplements. Four other trials also added home visits as a health system intervention (Kumar2008; leRoux 2013; Villar1992; Waiswa2015), while Klerman2001added additional clinic visits and extended time with clinicians. Kumar2008provided home visits with thermo-spot and home visits without thermo-spot as health system interventions. Wu2011, Wahlstrom2011and Waiswa2015each also provided equipment and/or medicines for health centres.

Outcomes
Apart from the trial primary outcome, the outcomes listed in the Characteristics of included studies tables refer to this review's prespecified primary and secondary outcomes. All trials reported additional outcomes not relevant to our review beyond those listed in the Characteristics of included studies tables.
Many trials had multiple primary outcomes including different combinations of the following priorities: neonatal and perinatal mortality, antenatal care coverage, healthcare utilisation, newborn care practices (including exclusive breastfeeding), maternal physical and mental health (including postpartum anaemia, treated urinary tract infection, indicators of social support, maternal depression, use of folic acid during pregnancy, tetanus immunisation, birth preparedness and satisfaction with care) and delivery practices (including assisted delivery, hospital delivery). Our 34 included trials had 23 different primary outcomes. Even with this diversity, our included trials most commonly targeted antenatal care coverage and neonatal mortality. Sixteen trials had primary outcomes with a specific antenatal care coverage component (Basinga2011; Darmstadt2010; Laken1995;, Majoko2007; Melnikow1997; Midhet2010; More2012; Mori2015; Morris 2004, Mullany2007; Omer2008; Richter2014; Wahlstrom2011; Waiswa2015; Walker2013; Wu2011), and 12 trials targeted neonatal or perinatal mortality (Azad2010; Baqui2008; Bhutta2011; Fottrell2013; Kirkwood2013; Kumar2008; Lewycka 2013; Manandhar2004; Midhet2010; More2012; Persson2013; Tripathy2010).
One trial was included based on unpublished data only (Wahlstrom2011). Two included trials contributed no usable outcome data to the review (Melnikow1997; Omer2008). The trial statistician for Mori2015provided unpublished, cluster-adjusted odds ratios for our use. See the Included studies tables for further details.

Excluded studies
Thirty trials were excluded from the review. Briefly, 27 trials did not assess an increase in antenatal care coverage as a central objective of the trial (Baqui2009; Bhutta2008; Colbourn2013; Dance1987; Doyle2014; Ellard2012; Ford2001; Gokcay1993; Homer2001; Ickovics2007; Jennings2010; Kafatos1989;Koniak-Griffin 1991;Koniak-Griffin 2000; Kusulasai1993; Leung2012; Miller2012; Munjanja1996; Olds1986; Olds1995a;Rodriguez-Angulo 2012; Schellenberg2011; Srinivasan1995; Tomlinson2014; Tough2006; Tough2007; Turan2001). Three studies were excluded for being of observational study design (Alisjahbana1995; Foord1995; Magriples2008). See the Characteristics of excluded studies table for more details.

Risk of bias in included studies
Because two included trials with multiple arms have been divided (Lewycka 2013 and Morris 2004), the total number of studies assessed for bias below is 36, rather than 34.
For the most part, risk of bias was low or unclear. See Figure2and Figure3. In our overall risk assessment only four studies were at high risk of bias: Omer2008(data not reported according to randomisation, unclear denominators); Walker2013(all data based on provider recall); Wu2011(unclear denominators, other interventions in trial area and poor implementation) and Wahlstrom2011(unpublished data, unclear analyses). In 16 trials, overall risk of bias was unclear (Basinga2011; Darmstadt2010; Fottrell2013; Laken1995; leRoux 2013; Lewycka2013b; Lewycka2013a; Melnikow1997; Midhet2010; More2012; Morris2004b; Morris2004a; Persson2013; Richter2014; Tripathy2010; Waiswa2015), and it was low in 16 trials (Azad2010; Baqui2008; Barber2008; Bhutta2011; Kenyon2012; Kirkwood2013; Klerman2001; Kumar2008; Lund2012; Majoko2007; Manandhar2004; Mori2015; Mullany2007; Penfold2014; Villar1992; Villar2001 (WHO 2001)).

Allocation

Random sequence generation
Random sequence generation was adequate (low risk of bias) in 30 trials (Azad2010; Baqui2008; Barber2008; Basinga2011; Bhutta2011; Darmstadt2010; Kenyon2012; Kirkwood2013; Kumar2008; Lewycka2013a; Lewycka2013b; Manandhar2004; Melnikow1997; Midhet2010; More2012; Mori2015; Morris2004a; Morris2004b; Mullany2007; Omer2008; Penfold2014; Persson2013; Richter2014; Tripathy2010; Villar1992; Villar2001 (WHO 2001); Wahlstrom2011; Waiswa2015; Walker2013; Wu2011), and unclear in six trials (Fottrell2013; Klerman2001; Laken1995; leRoux 2013; Lund2012; Majoko2007).

Allocation concealment
Seventeen trials were at low risk of bias for allocation concealment (Baqui2008; Fottrell2013; Kenyon2012; Kirkwood2013; Klerman2001; Kumar2008; leRoux 2013; Manandhar2004; Melnikow1997; Mori2015; Morris2004a; Morris2004b; Penfold2014; Richter2014; Villar1992; Villar2001 (WHO 2001); Waiswa2015). Risk of bias was unclear in 19 trials, where allocation concealment was unclear or not described at all (Azad2010; Barber2008; Basinga2011; Bhutta2011; Darmstadt2010; Laken1995; Lewycka2013a; Lewycka2013b; Lund2012; Majoko2007; Midhet2010; More2012; Mullany2007; Omer2008; Persson2013; Tripathy2010; Wahlstrom2011; Walker2013; Wu2011).

Blinding
Generally, blinding was not feasible in the trials included in this review. Large cluster-randomised trials with community or health-system relevant interventions will not achieve adequate blinding of women and staff. Most trials did make an attempt to prevent contamination between clusters, though. Where trial authors have reported lack of blinding, we have judged this to be of unclear risk of bias because we do not know for certain what kinds of bias may or may not have been introduced. We determined that it was unfair to judge studies that reported a lack of blinding as having a high risk of bias and studies that did not report at all as unclear risk of bias, when blinding might not have been feasible. The risk of bias in all trials due to lack of blinding will differ per outcome, and the impact of no blinding in cluster trials measuring mortality outcomes is also unclear. Where trials did not report blinding at all in published reports, we judged the trial as of unclear risk of bias due to lack of information. Overall, included trials did a much better job of attempting to blind outcomes assessors than participants and personnel.

Blinding of participants and personnel
Only one trial had adequate blinding of participants and low risk of bias (Basinga2011). Thirty-five trials had unclear risk of bias; these trials were either not blinded or the blinding of participants was not reported. (Azad2010; Barber2008; Baqui2008; Bhutta2011; Darmstadt2010; Fottrell2013; Kenyon2012; Kirkwood2013; Klerman2001; Kumar2008; Laken1995; leRoux 2013; Lewycka2013a; Lewycka2013b; Lund2012; Majoko2007; Manandhar2004; Melnikow1997; Midhet2010; More2012; Mori2015; Morris2004a; Morris2004b; Mullany2007; Omer2008; Penfold2014; Persson2013; Richter2014; Tripathy2010; Villar1992; Villar2001 (WHO 2001); Walker2013; Wahlstrom2011; Waiswa2015; Wu2011).

Blinding of outcome assessors
Twelve trials were at low risk of bias due to explicit blinding of data collectors and interviewers (Basinga2011; Bhutta2011; Fottrell2013; Kenyon2012; Klerman2001; leRoux 2013; Lewycka2013a; Lewycka2013b; Manandhar2004; Melnikow1997; More2012; Villar1992). Twenty-four trials were judged to have unclear risk of bias due to either no mention of blinding or lack of blinding of those collecting data (Azad2010; Baqui2008; Barber2008; Darmstadt2010; Kirkwood2013; Kumar2008; Laken1995; Lund2012; Majoko2007; Midhet2010; Mori2015; Morris2004a; Morris2004b; Mullany2007; Omer2008; Penfold2014; Persson2013; Richter2014; Tripathy2010; Villar2001 (WHO 2001); Wahlstrom2011; Waiswa2015; Walker2013; Wu2011).

Incomplete outcome data
Twenty-three trials were at low risk of bias with clear reporting of losses to follow-up (Basinga2011; Bhutta2011; Darmstadt2010; Fottrell2013; Kenyon2012; Kirkwood2013; Klerman2001; Kumar2008; Lund2012; Majoko2007; Manandhar2004; Midhet2010; More2012; Mori2015, Morris2004a; Morris2004b; Mullany2007; Penfold2014, Tripathy2010; Villar1992; Villar2001 (WHO 2001), Wahlstrom2011; Waiswa2015). Risk of bias was unclear in 11 trials due to confusing reporting or lack of reporting of follow-up (Azad2010; Baqui2008; Barber2008; Laken1995; leRoux 2013; Lewycka2013a; Lewycka2013b; Omer2008; Persson2013; Walker2013; Wu2011). One small trial was at high risk of bias due to 32% attrition (22/69) in the intervention arm lost to follow-up and excluded (Melnikow1997). Another trial (Richter2014) also had poor follow-up and was assessed as of high risk of bias (follow-up: 70% at post-birth interview; 57% at six months; 24% at 12 months).

Selective reporting
Twenty-four studies were at low risk of bias (Azad2010; Baqui2008; Barber2008; Basinga2011; Bhutta2011; Kenyon2012; Kirkwood2013; Klerman2001; Kumar2008; leRoux 2013; Lewycka2013a; Lewycka2013b; Lund2012; Majoko2007; Manandhar2004; More2012; Mori2015, Morris2004a; Morris2004b; Mullany2007; Persson2013; Villar1992; Villar2001 (WHO 2001); Wahlstrom2011), and in 11, risk of bias was unclear (Darmstadt2010; Fottrell2013; Laken1995; Melnikow1997; Midhet2010; Omer2008; Penfold2014; Richter2014; Tripathy2010; Walker2013; Wu2011). One trial (Waiswa2015) was assessed as of high risk because the authors have not yet published mortality data; preterm birth was also mentioned in the publication but no data reported; finally, data for low birthweight were not reported according to intervention arm in Waiswa2015.

Other potential sources of bias

Recruitment bias
Twenty-six trials were at low risk of bias (Baqui2008; Barber2008; Basinga2011; Bhutta2011; Darmstadt2010; Fottrell2013; Kenyon2012; Kirkwood2013; Klerman2001; Kumar2008; Laken1995; Lewycka2013a; Lund2012; Majoko2007; Manandhar2004; Melnikow1997; Morris2004a; Mullany2007; Omer2008; Penfold2014; Persson2013; Tripathy2010; Villar1992; Villar2001 (WHO 2001); Waiswa2015; Walker2013). Risk of bias was unclear for six trials (Azad2010; Midhet2010; More2012; Mori2015; Richter2014; Wu2011) and high for two trials: leRoux 2013(recruiters were redeployed to control clusters due to 22% fewer women in standard care) and Wahlstrom2011(authors reported problems with recruitment in the intervention clusters for the post-intervention survey).

Analysis bias
Twenty-two trials were at low risk of bias with clear reporting of methods used for adjustments and analysis (Azad2010; Baqui2008; Barber2008; Bhutta2011; Kenyon2012; Kirkwood2013; Kumar2008; Lewycka2013a; Lewycka2013b; Lund2012; Majoko2007; Melnikow1997; More2012; Mori2015; Morris2004a; Morris2004b: Mullany2007; Penfold2014; Persson2013; Richter2014; Villar2001 (WHO 2001); Waiswa2015). Risk of bias was unclear in 13 trials, largely due to missing ICCs and unclear methods of adjusting for clustering (Basinga2011; Darmstadt2010; Fottrell2013; Klerman2001; Laken1995; leRoux 2013; Manandhar2004; Midhet2010; Tripathy2010; Villar1992; Wahlstrom2011; Walker2013; Wu2011), and high in one trial, where results were not reported according to the randomisation group (Omer2008).

Other bias
In this section we assessed the trials for issues such as baseline imbalances, respect of allocation assignment, similarities between clusters, information bias, parallel non-trial interventions, changes in general living conditions and implementation of the intervention. Thirteen trials did not seem to have any other sources of bias (Baqui2008; Barber2008; Bhutta2011; Darmstadt2010; Kirkwood2013; Klerman2001; Kumar2008; Majoko2007; Manandhar2004; Melnikow1997; Mullany2007; Richter2014; Villar2001 (WHO 2001)). In 17 trials it was unclear how these issues might have introduced bias (Azad2010; Fottrell2013; Kenyon2012; Laken1995; leRoux 2013; Lewycka2013a; Lewycka2013b; Lund2012; Midhet2010; More2012; Mori2015; Omer2008; Penfold2014; Persson2013; Tripathy2010; Villar1992; Waiswa2015). Five trials were at high risk of bias from one or more of these sources: Basinga2011(allocation assignment was not respected due to government restructuring); Morris2004aand Morris2004b(unsuccessful implementation of service-level package in relevant clusters); Wahlstrom2011(baseline differences and recall bias for ANC visits outcome); Walker2013(baseline differences, recall and reporting bias); and Wu2011(baseline differences, unclear implementation)

Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison One intervention versus no intervention; Summary of findings 2 Combination of interventions versus no intervention
All analyses below were conducted with a random-effects model, because we expected and have found high heterogeneity due to differences in the interventions and targets of individual trials. We have reported the pooled effect estimates below and explained substantial heterogeneity findings where they occur, noting especially if the exclusion of trials of high risk of bias improved heterogeneity. In all analyses below we have combined cluster-randomised with individually-randomised trials. Most analysis have few, if any, individually-randomised trials. We have specifically noted where individually-randomised trials contribute outcome data.
We have included group totals on the forest plots for the review primary outcomes, for the first two comparisons. These numbers are for illustrative purposes only.
We have also included additional tables with event and participant totals for the outcomes relevant to our 'Summary of findings' tables.
GRADE assessments are found in parenthesis following estimates for 'Summary of findings' outcomes. We did not downgrade outcomes for heterogeneity if the I2was not greater than 60%.

Comparison 1: One intervention versus no intervention
All trials contributing data to the meta-analyses for this comparison were of cluster design, apart from one trial Kenyon2012(n = 1324; contributing data to outcomes for the main analyses Analysis 1.1; Analysis 1.11, and Analysis 1.13; and for subgroup and sensitivity analyses Analysis 6.1; Analysis 7.1; and Analysis 8.1.
Overall, meta-analyses identified modest effects for single interventions on two review outcomes. More women in intervention groups received at least four antenatal care visits ( high quality evidence ) and delivered their babies in health facilities ( high quality evidence ).

Primary outcomes
Antenatal care (ANC) coverage: four or more visits - results for this outcome had high heterogeneity, as would be expected due to differences among the trials' interventions and targets. Using an intra-cluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) of 0.02 showed marginal results favouring the interventions and substantial heterogeneity (average odds ratio (OR) 1.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01 to 1.22; studies = 10; 45,022 women; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.01; (P = 0.03); I² = 52%; GRADE assessment = high quality evidence ). The pooled effect using a more conservative ICC of 0.08 showed a similar marginal result in ANC coverage between treatment arms and substantial heterogeneity (average OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.22; studies = 10; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.01; (P = 0.04); I² = 49%).

Sensitivity analyses
We performed sensitivity analysis for the review primary outcomes of ANC coverage: four or more visits and pregnancy-related deaths by excluding trials with an overall assessment of high risk of bias. ANC coverage: four or more visits was recalculated without Walker2013. Results are shown in Analysis 7.1. Heterogeneity was reduced from 52% and 49% (using two ICCs) with Walker2013to 35% and 28% without. The pooled result shows no group differences in rates of ANC coverage, whether using an ICC of 0.02 (average OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.15; studies = nine; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.00; (P = 0.14); I² = 35%) or an ICC of 0.08 (average OR 1.05, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.14; studies = nine; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.00; (P = 0.20); I² = 28%). These two ICCs were obtained from reports of other studies (Manandhar2004; Wu2011; Pagel2011) and were used to determine the robustness of our findings to assumptions about the correct ICC.

Secondary outcomes
ANC coverage: one or more visits - pooled results show marginal improvement in coverage in the intervention arms; however, due to high levels of heterogeneity we would question whether this result is meaningful (average OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.79; studies = six; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.24;(P = 0.0009); I² = 76%; GRADE assessment = moderate quality evidence , downgraded once for high statistical heterogeneity; Analysis 1.3).

Intermittent prophylactic treatment for malaria - one trial, Darmstadt2010, reported this outcome, but we have excluded these data due to a national vaccine shortage during the study period. GRADE assessment not possible.
Proportion of women with tetanus protection at birth - high heterogeneity compromises our confidence in this finding, which shows no group differences for women receiving tetanus protection (average OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.15; studies = eight; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.01; (P = 0.02); I² = 57%; Analysis 1.8).

Perinatal mortality - trials had mixed results for improving rates of perinatal deaths, contributing to substantial heterogeneity for this outcome. The pooled result shows similar numbers of deaths in intervention and control study arms (average OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.07; studies = 15; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.01; (P = 0.003) I² = 58%; GRADE assessment = moderate quality evidence , downgraded once for design limitations in contributing trials; Analysis 1.13). Just two of 15 trials showed positive results for interventions (Kirkwood2013; Lund2012), while Persson2013had more deaths in the control arm. No trial contributing to this outcome was assessed as of high risk of bias overall, but several trials reported perinatal mortality calculated with different definitions of neonatal death. Lund2012included deaths up to 42 days; Baqui2008and Kirkwood2013included neonatal deaths to 28 days. Removing these trials from the analysis reduced the heterogeneity from 58% to 52% but made no difference to the pooled effect estimate. See alsoTable 6.

Exploration of publication bias
Four outcomes had 10 or more trials contributing data: 1.1 ANC: four or more visits (Figure4), 1.2 pregnancy-related deaths (Figure5), 1.6 deliveries in a health facility (Figure6) and 1.13 perinatal mortality (Figure7). We visually inspected funnel plots for these outcomes and found no conclusive evidence of asymmetry suggesting publication bias. Though two funnel plots displayed apparent asymmetry (1.1 (Figure4), and 1.6 (Figure6)), we did not downgrade evidence when assessing these outcomes with GRADE. Just one of the outlier trials in question had a significant result, and the weight that each these trials contributed to the pooled effect estimate was extremely low (< 1.5%). Finally, each of these outcomes had just the 10 trials required for the analysis, not more. For these reasons we do not feel that the apparent asymmetry should be interpreted as evidence of publication bias. We will reassess this interpretation when more trials are added in future updates of this review.

Comparison 2: A combination of interventions versus no intervention
All trials contributing data to the meta-analyses for this comparison were of cluster design, apart from Klerman2001(outcomes 2.10 and 2.11) and Laken1995(2.1, 2.2, 2.6, and 2.13).
There were clear benefits of the combined interventions with respect to antenatal care: far more women received at least one antenatal care visit in the intervention arms. Women were also far more likely to receive any ANC from a health professional and to receive tetanus protection at birth. Infants also benefited from combined interventions; they were less likely to be born of low birthweight and less likely to die during pregnancy or during the first seven days of life.

Primary outcomes
ANC coverage: four or more visits - there was no clear difference between groups with respect to ANC coverage with either ICC used (0.02 or 0.08). Results are: ICC 0.02 (average OR 1.48, 95% CI 0.99 to 2.21; studies = six; 7840 women; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.10; (P = 0.09); I² = 48%; GRADE assessment = low quality evidence due to design limitations in contributing trials and wide CI crossing the line of no effect) and ICC 0.08 (average OR 1.45, 95% CI 0.95 to 2.23; studies = six; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.09; (P = 0.17); I² = 35%); Analysis 2.1. One trial (Wahlstrom2011) had a considerably larger effect size than the others, but we considered this trial to be of high risk of bias due to questions about analysis methods in the trial. The data were unpublished and provided by the authors. (See Included Studies tables). Removal of Wahlstrom2011from the analysis 2.1 cancels out all of the heterogeneity but doesn't change the results. See alsoTable 7.

Sensitivity analyses
One primary outcome with substantial heterogeneity above included trials assessed as of high risk of bias.
ANC coverage: four or more visits (Analysis 2.1) - one trial (Wahlstrom2011) had a considerably larger effect size than the others, and we considered this trial to be of high risk of bias due to questions about analysis methods in the trial. The data were unpublished and provided by the authors. A second trial Wu2011was also assessed as of high risk of bias due to multiple bias concerns. (See Included studies tables). Removal of Wahlstrom2011from the analysis reduced the heterogeneity found for the ICC of 0.02 (originally I² = 48%). Removing both trials of high risk of bias likewise eliminates all heterogeneity for the ICC of 0.08 (I² = 35%). Both sensitivity analyses shift the overall estimates toward the line of no difference (ICC 0.02 average OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.40; studies = four) and ICC 0.08 (average OR 1.03, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.37; studies = four; Analysis 8.1).

Secondary outcomes
ANC coverage: one or more visits - women in intervention arms were much more likely to attend at least one antenatal care session (average OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.47 to 2.17; studies = five; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.00; (P = 0.84); I² = 0%; GRADE assessment = moderate quality evidence , downgraded once due to wide CI crossing the line of no effect; Analysis 2.3).

Pregnant women initiating ANC in the first trimester - for just one trial, a combined intervention did not encourage more women to attend ANC earlier in pregnancy (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.47; studies = one; Analysis 2.4).
Pregnany women receiving ANC from health professionals - women in intervention arms in two trials were much more likely to receive antenatal care from health professionals, though the analysis had high heterogeneity (average OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.67 to 5.30; studies = two; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.11; Chi² = 2.70, df = 1 (P = 0.10); I² = 63%; Analysis 2.5). We assessed one trial contributing data to this outcome as of high risk of bias (Wahlstrom2011). Both trials contributing data had interventions that combined education for pregnant women with provision of equipment/resources for health services (such as clean delivery kits); Wahlstrom2011also provided education for healthcare staff.
Deliveries in a health facility - women in intervention arms seemed to get more antenatal care (as above) and to deliver in health facilities more often than did women in control arms, though this difference in place of deliveries was not statistically significant (average OR 1.53, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.43; studies = five; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.00; (P = 0.99); I² = 0%; GRADE assessment = moderate quality evidence , downgraded once due to wide CI crossing the line of no effect; Analysis 2.6).

Intermittent prophylactic treatment for malaria - no trial included in this comparison reported this outcome. GRADE assessment not possible.
Proportion of women with tetanus protection at birth - far more women in the combined intervention arms received tetanus protection at birth (average OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.87; studies = three; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.01; (P = 0.23); I² = 33%; Analysis 2.8), though there was moderate heterogeneity for this outcome. None of the trials included in this analysis was assessed as of high risk of bias, so the finding of heterogeneity will most likely be due to differences in interventions. Kumar2008and Midhet2010both had cultural components to their combined interventions, while Morris2004btested financial incentives for women and for health systems. In fact, removing Morris2004bfrom the meta-analysis eliminated all of the heterogeneity found without changing the overall result (i.e. there is still a clear difference between groups).
Preterm labour - just one individual randomised trial (Klerman2001) reported this outcome, with no clear benefit for women in the intervention arm (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.20; participants = 607; studies = one; Analysis 2.9).
Low birthweight - two trials (Klerman2001; leRoux 2013) found clear benefits of combined interventions of education and augmented antenatal care; women were far less likely to give birth to infants of low birthweight (average OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.80; studies = two; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.00; (P = 0.68); I² = 0%; GRADE assessment = moderate quality evidence , downgraded once due to design limitations in contributing trials; Analysis 2.10).

Perinatal mortality - more babies survived when born to women in combined intervention arms (average OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.95; studies = five; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.06; (P = 0.0001); I² = 83%; GRADE assessment = moderate quality evidence , downgraded once due to high statistical heterogeneity; Analysis 2.11). Extremely high heterogeneity for this analysis cannot be explained due to trials of high risk of bias. Heterogeneity is most likely explained by the different interventions in the contributing trials and the considerable differences in effect sizes; three large trials in India and Pakistan found highly significant effects (Bhutta2011; Kumar2008; Midhet2010) while, other trials found no group differences. We must advise caution when interpreting this result due to the high heterogeneity found. We excluded the perinatal mortality data from one trial relevant to this analysis (Wu2011) due to multiple risk of bias concerns, including unclear group denominators. See alsoTable 12.

Exploration of publication bias
No outcome in this comparison had the required 10 trials contributing data.

Comparison 3: Two interventions compared
No included trial tested different single interventions head to head.

Comparison 4: Combined interventions versus one intervention
All trials contributing to this comparison were of cluster-randomised design.

Primary outcomes
ANC coverage: four or more visits - there was no evidence of a difference between single or combined interventions using an ICC of 0.02 (average OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.40; studies = two; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.04; (P = 0.12); I² = 60%; Analysis 4.1). Neither trial was assessed as of high risk of bias. The interventions in both trials involved a community education intervention for pregnant women and a facility strengthening component for health systems. Azad2010(Bangladesh) was a much larger trial than Waiswa2015(Uganda), with a higher proportion of women receiving four ANC visits.
Pregnancy-related deaths - there was no evidence that interventions could reduce pregnancy-related deaths (average OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.96; studies = two; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.12; (P = 0.19); I² = 43%; Analysis 4.2). Different effect sizes as well as differences in interventions likely contributed to the heterogeneity found in this analysis. Tripathy2010(India) was three times larger than the Azad2010(Bangladesh) trial and had no facility strengthening component, as in Azad2010.

Sensitivity analysis
No trial contributing to the primary outcomes for this comparison was judged to be of high risk of bias.

Secondary outcomes
ANC coverage: one or more visits - there was no evidence that combined interventions were more effective than single interventions in three trials (average OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.20; studies = three; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.02; (P = 0.33); I² = 11%; Analysis 4.3).
Deliveries in a health facility - similar proportions of pregnant women delivered in health facilities (average OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.30; studies = three; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.00; (P = 0.92); I² = 0%; Analysis 4.4).
Perinatal mortality - two trials found mixed results for perinatal mortality. Tripathy2010found a reduction in perinatal mortality, though Azad2010did not (average OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.07; studies = two; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.02; (P = 0.02); I² = 83%; Analysis 4.5). Very high heterogeneity makes us doubt whether this pooled result is meaningful.
Proportion of women with tetanus protection at birth - there was no evidence of group differences for women who received tetanus protection (average OR 1.07, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.43; studies = two; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.03; (P = 0.18); I² = 44%; Analysis 4.6). Again, substantial heterogeneity likely has to do with differences between the interventions between the Tripathy2010(India) and Azad2010(Bangladesh) trials, as above.
Outcomes not reported in the included studies: low birthweight; preterm labour; intermittent prophylactic treatment for malaria; proportion of women who received ANC from professional health workers; pregnant women with a written birth and emergency plan by 37 weeks; pregnant women screened for syphilis; pregnant women screened for asymptomatic bacteriuria; pregnant women screened for HIV; pregnant women receiving a complete antiretroviral course for prevention of HIV transmission; and maternal near miss defined as: "a woman who nearly died but survived a complication that occurred during pregnancy, childbirth or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy" (Pattinson2009).

Exploration of publication bias
No outcome in this comparison had 10 trials contributing data.

Comparison 5: Different combinations of interventions
One individually-randomised trial was included in this comparison. Mullany2007(n = 383) compared three groups: in one arm women attended education sessions alone and received health education flyers; in a second arm women attended education sessions with their husbands and received education health flyers; a third arm received health educational flyers. All pregnant women received standard antenatal care. For this analysis, we have combined the arms receiving education sessions and flyers and compared these with the control arm receiving only flyers.

Primary outcomes
ANC coverage: four or more antenatal visits - there were no group differences in women's attendance of antenatal care (average OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.43; studies = one; Analysis 5.1).
Pregnancy-related deaths - Mullany2007did not report this outcome.

Sensitivity analysis
Only one trial was included these analyses.

Secondary outcomes
One or more ANC visits - this outcome was not reported in Mullany2007.
Deliveries in a health facility - there was no evidence of a difference in rates of women who delivered in health facilities (average OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.71 to 3.37; studies = one; Analysis 5.4).
Outcomes not reported in the included study under this comparison: the trial did not report any of the following review secondary outcomes: pregnant women initiating ANC in first trimester, pregnant women receiving ANC from health professional, intermittent prophylactic treatment for malaria, proportion of women with tetanus protection, proportion of women treated for syphilis, proportion of women with HIV who received a complete anti-retroviral course for the prevention of transmission of HIV from mother to child, preterm labour, low birthweight, perinatal mortality.

Exploration of publication bias
Only one trial was included in these analyses.

Analysis 6: Subgroup analysis
The subgroup analyses were limited to the two primary outcomes of the review: ANC (at least four visits) and maternal deaths. We compared any interventions or combinations of interventions with no intervention or single interventions.
We were not able to conduct analyses for urban versus rural settings because our trials were overwhelmingly rural. For example, 13 of 18 trials contributing data for the primary outcome of ANC coverage (at least four visits) took place in rural settings, with just three in urban settings (one trial had mixed settings and one trial report was unclear).
We conducted subgroup analysis with trials targeting the health system versus trials targeting the population. Becasue several trials included both types of interventions, though, the number of trials included in subgroup analysis is not representative of the included studies overall.
We conducted subgroup analyses comparing trials set in upper-middle- and high-income countries versus trials set in low- or lower-middle-income countries, for the outcome of ANC coverage (at least four visits) only. There were insufficient data for this analysis for the primary outcome of maternal mortality, because just three of 13 trials contributing data were conducted in higher-income settings.
For the review primary outcomes of ANC coverage: at least four visits and pregnancy-related deaths, there were no clear differences between treatment arms in any subgroup reported below.
Health Systems versus Population ANC coverage: four or more visits - there was no evidence of subgroup differences between trials classed as health systems interventions and trials targeting populations (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 0.77, df = 1 (P = 0.38), I² = 0%). There were no discernable effects of the interventions on coverage, either, and there was substantial heterogeneity in the health systems subgroup (See Analysis 6.1). The pooled result for health systems interventions was (average OR 1.13, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.34; studies = five; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.02; (P = 0.04); I² = 60%), and for population interventions was (average OR 1.04, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.13; studies = four; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.00; (P = 0.38); I² = 2%).
Health Systems versus Population Pregnancy-related deaths - there was no evidence of subgroup differences between trial types for maternal deaths (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 0.91, df = 1 (P = 0.34), I² = 0%; See Analysis 6.2). There was no evidence of heterogeneity in either subgroup, and no evidence that trials had any impact to reduce mortality in intervention arms. The pooled effect for health systems trials was (average OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.41 to 3.65; studies = four; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.00; (P = 0.50); I² = 0%), while for trials targeting populations the result was (average OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.03; studies = eight; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.00; (P = 0.92); I² = 0%). Population interventions look more promising for women in this instance, but all trials were underpowered to show a statistically significant impact on rates of maternal mortality. We split the control group between Lewycka2013aand Lewycka2013bfor analysis, so no results have been double counted.
Country Income Low versus High ANC coverage: four or more visits - there was no evidence that interventions worked differently in high- or low-income countries (test for subgroup differences: Chi² = 0.43, df = 1 (P = 0.51), I² = 0%; See Analysis 6.3). Interventions made a marginal difference in the proportion of women receiving at least four antenatal visits in low- and lower middle-income countries, with moderate heterogeneity observed (average (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.40; participants = 46009; studies = 11; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.03; I² = 58%). Treatment groups had similar rates of ANC coverage in upper-middle-income or high-income countries, with moderate heterogeneity between trials (average OR 1.12, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.32; studies = 7; Heterogeneity: Tau² = 0.01; I² = 40%). We calculated estimates for Morris2004aand Morris2004busing a split control group so no women were counted twice.

Discussion
In this review, we synthesised evidence relating to interventions with the potential to improve antenatal care (ANC) coverage and other outcomes. We included 34 trials involving approximately 400,000 women. Despite our attempts to categorise the trials in a meaningful way (health system versus community), we found very disparate results, with very few interventions improving ANC coverage. Most of the trials were similar in design and choice of participants and were in run in low-resource rural settings - where ANC coverage is low. However, the interventions were varied and complex, with different levels of compliance and implementation. We noted specific instances where health system changes impeded the conduct of trial (Morris2004a; Wu2011). In most instances, the control group received some form of care. With regards to the outcomes, some studies did not explicitly target improvements in ANC, but reported them as an outcome. This raises questions as to whether these trials were sufficiently powered to detect differences in ANC coverage. Most of the studies were cluster trials, but their sizes differed greatly. Follow-up time also differed substantially. Our findings suggest that it is unlikely that one type of intervention is substantially better than another, but a combination of interventions may yield stronger effect.
Despite these issues some interventions proved to be beneficial. These findings should be interpreted in the light of substantial heterogeneity and the pragmatic nature of the trials. In addition, subtleties in how interventions are combined must be considered. From this systematic review, we can draw a general picture of the effects of health system and community level interventions on ANC coverage and other materno-fetal outcomes. Our pooled estimates should respond to the question of whether interventions aimed at improving ANC coverage and other outcomes actually work. Our results could not identify which specific interventions were most effective.

Summary of main results

One intervention versus no intervention
When one intervention was compared to none, we found marginal improvements in ANC (at least four visits). This finding was not robust to sensitivity analysis with a more conservative intra-cluster correlation co-efficient (ICC) and excluding studies at high risk of bias and shifted the estimate towards no effect (GRADE assessment = high quality evidence ).There was no effect on pregnancy-related deaths ( low quality evidence ), perinatal mortality ( moderate quality evidence ) or low birthweight ( high quality evidence ). No studies reported on receiving intermittent prophylactic treatment for malaria in this comparison. The interventions led to modest improvements in the number of deliveries in health facilities ( high quality evidence ) and in the proportion of women having at least one ANC visit ( moderate quality evidence ).

Two or more interventions versus no intervention
When two or more interventions were combined in comparison to none, we found no improvements in ANC coverage (four or more visits; low quality evidence ) or pregnancy-related deaths ( moderate quality evidence ). However, the interventions led to improvements in ANC coverage (at least one visit; moderate quality evidence ), perinatal mortality ( moderate quality evidence ) and low birthweight ( moderate quality evidence ). No trials in this comparison reported on intermittent prophylactic treatment for malaria.

One intervention versus a combination of interventions
When one intervention was compared to a combination of other interventions, there was no improvement in ANC coverage (four or more visits and least one visit), pregnancy-related deaths, deliveries in a health facility or perinatal mortality. No trials in this comparison reported on low birthweight or intermittent prophylactic treatment of malaria.

Subgroups
There were no discernable differences in effect when health system interventions were compared to community interventions. With respect to the proportion of women receiving at least four antenatal visits, all interventions had a more positive impact in low- and lower-middle-income countries, but this difference did not reach statistical significance.

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

Completeness of evidence
We applied standard Cochrane methods our searches and screening procedures. We also contacted study authors to provide incomplete or missing information. We are confident that this review is a comprehensive representation of the existing body of literature. A considerable number of trials have been conducted with interventions that may improve ANC or other materno-fetal outcomes. As expected, most of the trials were of cluster design and conducted in rural settings, in many low- and middle-income countries. There were little to no data on outcomes such as: pregnant women with a written birth and emergency plan by 37 weeks; pregnant women screened for asymptomatic bacteriuria; pregnant women screened for syphilis; pregnant women screened for HIV; pregnant women receiving a complete antiretroviral course for prevention of HIV transmission and maternal near miss. These outcomes are important for determining the mechanism by which ANC improves materno-fetal outcomes.

Applicability of evidence
The trials included in this review targeted the right participants (women in their reproductive years or pregnant women) and were conducted mostly in the regions of the world with low ANC coverage and high maternal mortality. For the most part, the interventions included in this review built upon existing health system or community resources and should be applicable in similar settings. However, local health system realities should be considered, particularly for interventions that target policies and other components of the health system.

Quality of the evidence
The evidence for the comparison of one intervention versus none was generally high to moderate, with low quality for one outcome (pregnancy-related deaths) in which many of the studies contributing to the data had design limitations.
The evidence for the comparison of two or more interventions to no intervention was moderate to low, due to design limitations in trials, statistical heterogeneity and wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect (imprecision).
We have not downgraded the following outcomes: four or more ANC visits and deliveries in a health facility, for apparent asymmetry in funnel plots. The trials that appear on the plots as outliers are mostly small studies, contributing very little (< 5%) to the overall effect estimate. These studies also have confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect. We were therefore not convinced that these trials contributed to inflated effect estimates due to publication bias. In addition, we sought and included unpublished data in our analysis.

Potential biases in the review process
We conducted a comprehensive search of the literature and have no reason to believe any relevant trials were left out. We completed study selection, appraisal and data extraction in duplicate. However, some systematic error (precision of pooled estimates) might have been introduced in our choice of ICC. We conducted sensitivity analyses with different ICCs to mitigate this potential bias. There was considerable clinical and statistical heterogeneity in most of the analyses, for which we present only random-effects pooled estimates to embrace this heterogeneity. However, for readers interested in the effects of specific interventions, such aggregation might be questioned.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews
Other systematic reviews have evaluated the effects of specific interventions on materno-fetal outcomes and reported similar results. For example, in a systematic review of participatory women’s groups only one study showed an improvement in ANC coverage, despite a general improvement in other maternal and neonatal outcomes (Prost2013). Community-based intervention packages were demonstrated to improve maternal and fetal outcomes (Kidney2009; Lassi2015). Multiple micronutrients were shown to reduce low birthweight (Haider2012). Antenatal nutritional advice reduced risk of preterm birth, increased head circumference at birth and increased protein intake (Ota2015). A multi-country survey of facility deliveries in 29 countries found that substantial reductions in maternal mortality require improvements in maternal care and the availability of comprehensive emergency care (Souza2013). These reports suggest that some interventions at the health system level or community level improve materno-fetal outcomes. In addition, an economic evaluation of strategies to improve healthcare practice and healthcare seeking for maternal and neonatal health found them to be cost effective (Mangham-Jefferies 2014). To the best of our knowledge, this review is the first to focus on all interventions that may improve ANC coverage. The review's broad scope limits its comparability to other published reviews.

Authors' conclusions

Implications for practice
Single interventions may improve ANC coverage (at least one visit and four or more visits) and deliveries in health facilities.
Combined interventions may improve ANC coverage (at least one visit), reduce perinatal mortality and reduce the occurrence of low birthweight.
The effects of the interventions are unrelated to whether they are community of health system interventions.

Implications for research
For cluster-randomised trials, more details should be provided in reporting numerators and denominators. The ICCs used to adjust for cluster effects should be reported routinely. There is a need for uniform reporting of outcomes so that they are comparable to commonly used population indicators. Given that combinations of interventions seem to have a superior effect to single interventions, further research is required on the most appropriate combinations that would maximise impact. As such, we recommend further cluster-randomised trials of pregnant women and women in their reproductive years, using combinations of interventions and looking at patient important outcomes like maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality, alongside the explanatory outcomes along the pathway of care: ANC coverage, the services provided during ANC and deliveries in health facilities.
