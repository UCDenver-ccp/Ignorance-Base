May-10,PMC2889879,"The absorption of dietary vitamin D is generally high at all stages of life [34], but serum levels also depend on the endogenous production of vitamin D due to sun exposure which is subject to seasonal variations","{'ALTERNATIVE_OPTIONS_CONTROVERSY', 'PROBABLE_UNDERSTANDING', 'DIFFICULT_TASK'}","[('generally', 'PROBABLE_UNDERSTANDING'), ('but', 'ALTERNATIVE_OPTIONS_CONTROVERSY'), ('variations', 'DIFFICULT_TASK')]"

Apr-12,PMC3348565,"Genotyping, which was not practical in our study setting, might have aided the interpretation of our findings, as shown in a vitamin D supplementation trial for tuberculosis","{'DIFFICULT_TASK', 'INCOMPLETE_EVIDENCE'}","[('not practical', 'DIFFICULT_TASK'), ('might', 'INCOMPLETE_EVIDENCE'), ('interpretation', 'INCOMPLETE_EVIDENCE'), ('as_shown', 'INCOMPLETE_EVIDENCE')]"
Apr-12,PMC3348565,"As in our studies, these inconsistent findings point to the existence of complicated pathways for the function of vitamin D in disease processes, or simply that the correct effective dose of vitamin D supplementation needs to be better defined","{'ALTERNATIVE_OPTIONS_CONTROVERSY', 'DIFFICULT_TASK', 'INCOMPLETE_EVIDENCE', 'FUTURE_WORK'}","[('as_in', 'INCOMPLETE_EVIDENCE'), ('inconsistent', 'ALTERNATIVE_OPTIONS_CONTROVERSY'), ('point', 'INCOMPLETE_EVIDENCE'), ('complicated', 'DIFFICULT_TASK'), ('needs', 'FUTURE_WORK'), ('better', 'INCOMPLETE_EVIDENCE')]"
Apr-12,PMC3348565,"In populations with similar characteristics, quarterly population level supplementation of vitamin D to infants and young children is not a policy option for reducing the burden of pneumonia in children","{'IMPORTANT_CONSIDERATION', 'DIFFICULT_TASK'}","[('is not ... option', 'DIFFICULT_TASK'), ('the burden', 'IMPORTANT_CONSIDERATION')]"
Aug-12,PMC3427250,"However there is so far no conclusive evidence about the causality of these relationships, as no randomised controlled trials of vitamin D supplementation with an appropriate assessment of a variety of health outcomes have been carried out to date[21]","{'ANOMALY_CURIOUS_FINDING', 'DIFFICULT_TASK', 'INCOMPLETE_EVIDENCE', 'FULL_UNKNOWN', 'SUPERFICIAL_RELATIONSHIP'}","[('however', 'ANOMALY_CURIOUS_FINDING'), ('no_conclusive_evidence', 'INCOMPLETE_EVIDENCE'), ('relationships', 'SUPERFICIAL_RELATIONSHIP'), ('no...trials', 'FULL_UNKNOWN'), ('variety', 'DIFFICULT_TASK')]"
Jan-17,PMC5273824,"The serum level of 25-OH Vitamin D2 in the intervention group was 11.61 ± 6.71 (6.06–24.71) nmol/L, however, the serum 25-OH Vitamin D2 level in the fourteen cases in the control group was too low to be detected with the current technology (Table 2)","{'ALTERNATIVE_OPTIONS_CONTROVERSY', 'DIFFICULT_TASK'}","[('however', 'ALTERNATIVE_OPTIONS_CONTROVERSY'), ('too...to_be', 'DIFFICULT_TASK')]"
Jun-18,PMC6011374,"This may be explained, in part, by inadequate control of related risk factors and confounders in statistical analyses, variations between assays that measure vitamin D and significant heterogeneity between studied populations [6]","{'DIFFICULT_TASK', 'INCOMPLETE_EVIDENCE', 'SUPERFICIAL_RELATIONSHIP', 'PROBLEM_COMPLICATION'}","[('may_be', 'INCOMPLETE_EVIDENCE'), ('in_part', 'INCOMPLETE_EVIDENCE'), ('inadequate', 'PROBLEM_COMPLICATION'), ('related', 'SUPERFICIAL_RELATIONSHIP'), ('confounders', 'PROBLEM_COMPLICATION'), ('variations', 'DIFFICULT_TASK'), ('heterogeneity', 'DIFFICULT_TASK')]"
Jun-18,PMC6011374,"Given that the month in which the serum was sampled heavily influences vitamin D status, “standardised” serum 25(OH)D concentrations were calculated as previously described [34] in order to normalise against seasonal variation","{'DIFFICULT_TASK', 'SUPERFICIAL_RELATIONSHIP'}","[('influences', 'SUPERFICIAL_RELATIONSHIP'), ('variation', 'DIFFICULT_TASK')]"
